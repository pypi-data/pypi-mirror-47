        This repository contains custom pipes and models related to using spaCy for scientific documents.
        
        In particular, there is a custom tokenizer that adds tokenization rules on top of spaCy's
        rule-based tokenizer, a POS tagger and syntactic parser trained on biomedical data and
        an entity span detection model. Separately, there are also NER models for more specific tasks.
        
        
        ## Installation
        Installing scispacy requires two steps: installing the library and intalling the models. To install the library, run:
        ```bash
        pip install scispacy
        ```
        
        to install a model (see our full selection of available models below), run a command like the following:
        
        ```bash
        pip install https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ai2-s2-scispacy/releases/v0.2.0/en_core_sci_sm-0.2.0.tar.gz
        ```
        
        Note: We strongly recommend that you use an isolated Python environment (such as virtualenv or conda) to install scispacy.
        Take a look below in the "Setting up a virtual environment" section if you need some help with this.
        Additionally, scispacy uses modern features of Python and as such is only available for **Python 3.6 or greater**.
        
        
        
        #### Setting up a virtual environment
        
        [Conda](https://conda.io/) can be used set up a virtual environment with the
        version of Python required for scispaCy.  If you already have a Python 3.6 or 3.7
        environment you want to use, you can skip to the 'installing via pip' section.
        
        1.  [Download and install Conda](https://conda.io/docs/download.html).
        
        2.  Create a Conda environment called "scispacy" with Python 3.6:
        
            ```bash
            conda create -n scispacy python=3.6
            ```
        
        3.  Activate the Conda environment. You will need to activate the Conda environment in each terminal in which you want to use scispaCy.
        
            ```bash
            source activate scispacy
            ```
        
        Now you can install `scispacy` and one of the models using the steps above.
        
        
        Once you have completed the above steps and downloaded one of the models below, you can load a scispaCy model as you would any other spaCy model. For example:
        ```python
        import spacy
        nlp = spacy.load("en_core_sci_sm")
        doc = nlp("Alterations in the hypocretin receptor 2 and preprohypocretin genes produce narcolepsy in some animals.")
        ```
        
        #### Note on upgrading
        If you are upgrading `scispacy`, you will need to download the models again, to get the model versions compatible with the version of `scispacy` that you have. The link to the model that you download should contain the version number of `scispacy` that you have.
        
        ## Available Models
        
        To install a model, click on the link below to download the model, and then run 
        
        ```python
        pip install </path/to/download>
        ```
        
        Alternatively, you can install directly from the URL by right-clicking on the link, selecting "Copy Link Address" and running 
        ```python
        pip install CMD-V(to paste the copied URL)
        ```
