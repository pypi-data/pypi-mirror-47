# armm
Code that calculates transmittace and reflectance of materials at millimeter 
wavelengths.

This code is under active development. Use at your own risk.

# TODO
 * Implement off-normal incidence calculations
 * Implement basic viz tools
 * Better documentation
   * make this README less bad
   * better docstrings
   * examples
 * More tests
   * write tests for the model and layer classes
   * figure out integration tests in general
 * Set up CI
 * Set up codecov

*Note:* The core calculations done by this code are fairly stable in simple, 
normal-incidence cases. Bugs and implementation problems definitely exist for 
off-normal incidence use. Sorry about that. I am working to fix these things in 
my free time.
