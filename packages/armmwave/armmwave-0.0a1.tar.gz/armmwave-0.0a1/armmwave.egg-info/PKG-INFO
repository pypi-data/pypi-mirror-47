Description: # armm
        Code that calculates transmittace and reflectance of materials at millimeter 
        wavelengths.
        
        This code is under active development. Use at your own risk.
        
        # TODO
         * Implement off-normal incidence calculations
         * Implement basic viz tools
         * Better documentation
           * make this README less bad
           * better docstrings
           * examples
         * More tests
           * write tests for the model and layer classes
           * figure out integration tests in general
         * Set up CI
         * Set up codecov
        
        *Note:* The core calculations done by this code are fairly stable in simple, 
        normal-incidence cases. Bugs and implementation problems definitely exist for 
        off-normal incidence use. Sorry about that. I am working to fix these things in 
        my free time.
