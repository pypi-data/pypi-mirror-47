Description: # armm
        Code that calculates transmittace and reflectance of materials at millimeter 
        wavelengths.
        
        This code is under active development. While it has been verified against 
        experimental data (examples will be uploaded soon), you should take caution when 
        using the code.
        
        # TODO
         * Implement off-normal incidence calculations
         * Implement basic viz tools
         * Better documentation
           * make this README less bad
           * better docstrings
           * examples
         * Figure out how to get TravisCI to build wheels for me...
        
        *Note:* The core calculations done by this code are fairly stable in simple, 
        normal-incidence cases. Bugs and implementation problems definitely exist for 
        off-normal incidence use. Sorry about that. I am working to fix these things in 
        my free time.
