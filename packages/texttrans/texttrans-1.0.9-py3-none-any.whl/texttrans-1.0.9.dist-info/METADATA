text-trans
===

It computes a transition probability of a text.


## Description

I want to determine if a word was randomly generated. 
I guess that it can be determined by text transition probabilities trained from correct words.

## Install

```shell
$ pip install texttrans
```


## Usage


### default

Transition probability is computed for English words. I use "words_alpha.txt" of [dwyl/english-words](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words) to train default probability.

```python
from texttrans.texttrans import TextTrans
p = TextTrans().prob("pen")
print(p)
```

```
0.11640052876679541
```

### training

It prepares a text file that lists words, e.g. like below.

```txt:train.txt
hogehoge
piyopiyo
```

It train text transtion of input text.

```python
from texttrans.texttrans import TextTrans

train_path = "train.txt"
model_path = "model.pki"

tt1 = TextTrans(lang=None)
tt1.train(train_path= train_path, save_path= model_path)
print("p =", tt.prob("hoge"))
```

It computes the probability according to trained model.

```
tt2 = TextTrans(model_path=model_path)
print("p =", tt.prob("hoge"))
```
