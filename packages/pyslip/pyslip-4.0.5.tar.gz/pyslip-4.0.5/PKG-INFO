Description: pySlip
        ======
        
        pySlip is a 'slip map' widget for wxPython.
        
        During my work writing geophysical applications in python I often wanted to
        display a map that was very large - many hundreds of thousands of pixels in
        width.  I searched around for a GUI solution that would work rather like Google
        maps: tiled, layers, etc.  I couldn't find anything that didn't assume
        browser+map server.  So I wrote my own wxPython widget.  This worked well for
        cartesian self-generated maps and has been extended to handle non-cartesian
        maps and tiles sourced from places like OpenStreetMap.
        
        It's a poor thing, but solves my problem.  I'm placing it here in the hope that
        someone else may find it useful.  If you find it useful, or make improvements
        to it, drop me a line.
        
        The earlier 3.0.x release was for python 2.x only on Windows, Linux and macOS.
        This version works with wxPython 4.0+ and Python 3.6+.  It may work on earlier
        python 3 versions, but this has not been tested.  It has been tested on Linux
        but not Windows or macOS, yet.
        
        The widget API is documented in
        `the wiki <https://github.com/rzzzwilson/pySlip/wiki/The-pySlip-API>`_.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You install pySlip in the usual PyPi way: pip install pyslip .
        
        Before running the `pyslip_demo.py` program you must copy the
        pySlip/pyslip/examples/gmt_local_tiles.zip file to your home directory and unzip
        it there.  That should create a directory named `gmt_local_tiles`.
