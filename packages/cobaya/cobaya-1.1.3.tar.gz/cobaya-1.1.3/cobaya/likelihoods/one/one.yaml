# Constant (unit) likelihood

likelihood:
  one:
    # 1. artificial delay in lik computation  
    delay: 0  # seconds
    # 2. prefix of the parameters names
    prefix: ""
    # Noise (to aide computation of flat prior volume)
    noise:  # set to a small number, necessarily smaller than 1/volume
