        # KeywordTree
        
        A Python data structure that maps arbitrary text to values by using a decision-tree-like algorithm based on counting keyword occurrences.

        ### How it works
        
        * Each node contains a list of keywords and a value if it's a leaf.
        * A query is given as a string and is broken into tokens by a tokenizer.
        * Starting from the root, the query follows the child with the most keywords present in the query token list.
        * When a leaf is reached, its value is returned.
        * If there are multiple nodes with the most keywords in the token list, the query follows all of them and the results are merged at the end into a list.
        
        
        ### Example
        
        Suppose we have the above tree and the query "My pug is so young it can barely woof".
        
        The default tokenizer converts the query to lowercase and splits at whitespaces, so the tokens will be `['my', 'pug', 'is', 'so', 'young', 'it', 'can', 'barely','woof']`.
        
        The query will follow the left child of the root, since it has one match for `'woof'` and will then match the child with `'pug'` in its keywords. Since it's a leaf, its value will be in the final result: `['Pug']`.
        
        
        ### Usage
        
        `KeywordTree` instances are constructed from tuples of the form (list of keywords, list of children described as tuples, value).
        
        Non-leaf nodes must have value equal to `None`.
        
        ```python
        from keywordtree import KeywordTree
        
        kt = KeywordTree([], [
            (['dog', 'woof'], [
                (['bulldog'], [], 'Bulldog'),
                (['pug'], [], 'Pug'),
                (['boxer'], [], 'Boxer'),
            ], None),
            (['cat', 'meow'], [
                (['persian'], [], 'Persian'),
                (['bengal'], [], 'Bengal'),
                (['siamese'], [], 'Siamese'),
            ], None),
        ], None)
        
        kt.query('My pug is so young it can barely woof')
        # ['Pug']
        ```
        
        Other tokenizers can be used as well:
        
        ```python
        from keywordtree import KeywordTree
        from nltk.tokenize.stanford import StanfordTokenizer
        
        stftk = StanfordTokenizer()
        
        def tokenizer(s):
            return stftk.tokenize(s)
        
        kt = KeywordTree([], [
            # list of children
        ], None, tokenizer=tokenizer)
        ```
