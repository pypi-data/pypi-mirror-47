        A module for working with the AquaIllumination range of aquarium lights.
        The following functions are currently supported
        
        -  Support for the HD range of lights, including single lights, paired
           lights (of the same model) and paired lights (with mixed models)
        -  Enabling/Disabling the schedule
        -  Querying the current brightness of the lights
        -  Setting the brightness of the lights
        
        This library has been primarily tested with Prime HD and Hydra 26HD
        lights, as that is what the author owns. Hydra 52 HDs should work but
        haven't been validated. Also the non-HD range of lights are not
        currently supported, although it should be possible to add that support.
        If you would like to help fix either of these cases, please contact me
        via GitHub or by email.
        
        This module is in no way endorsed by AquaIllumination and you use it at
        your own risk. It could, and probably does, invalidate your warranty.

        Quickstart
        ----------
        
        Install aquaipy using ``pip``: ``$ pip install aquaipy``. Once that is
        complete you can import the AquaIPy class and connect to your lights.
        
        In this guide synchronous calls are shown but v2.0.0 of AquaIPy was a
        we-write, to provide async support. Synchronous functions are still
        supported but they are just wrappers of the async functions.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >>> from aquaipy import AquaIPy
            >>> ai = AquaIPy()
            >>> ai.connect("192.168.1.100")
        
        Once the class is initialised and connected, you can query and update
        your light.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            >> ai.get_colors_brightness()
            {'blue': 18.7,
             'cool_white': 4.4,
             'deep_red': 1.0,
             'green': 1.3,
             'royal': 18.4,
             'uv': 46.3,
             'violet': 46.8}
            >>> ai.update_color_brightness('cool_white', 33.333)
            <Response.Success: 0>
            >>> ai.update_color_brightness('deep_red', -15.2)
            <Response.Success: 0>
