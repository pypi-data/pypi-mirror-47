IPXE images and tools
---------------------

This directory contains IPXE images and tools for building those images.
If you are an OVB user you are probably most interested in the pre-built
images, ipxe-boot.qcow2 and ipxe-boot-41.qcow2.  The former is a minimal
version of an image that only contains the necessary bits to PXE boot a
cloud instance.  The latter image is the same, except its virtual size has
been changed to 41 GB so it can be used as the base image for instances whose
flavor bases the instance root disk size on the image size.

There is also a diskimage-builder element and a makefile that can be used to
rebuild the ipxe-boot.qcow2 image.  Simply run ``make`` to build the image.
