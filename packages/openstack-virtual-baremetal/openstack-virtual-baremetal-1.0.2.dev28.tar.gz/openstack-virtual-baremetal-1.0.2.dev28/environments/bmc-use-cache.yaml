# title: Enable Instance Status Caching in BMC
# description: |
#   Enable caching of instance status in the BMC.  This should reduce load on
#   the host cloud, but at the cost of potential inconsistency if the state
#   of a baremetal instance is changed without using the BMC.
parameter_defaults:
  # Enable instance status caching on the BMC.  This can reduce load on the
  # host cloud, but if an instance's status is changed outside the BMC it may
  # become out of sync.
