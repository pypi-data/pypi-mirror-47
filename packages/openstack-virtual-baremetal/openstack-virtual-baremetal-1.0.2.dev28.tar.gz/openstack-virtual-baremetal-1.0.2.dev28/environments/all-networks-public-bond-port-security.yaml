# title: Deploy with All Networks Enabled and Two Public Interfaces
# description: |
#   Deploy an OVB stack that adds interfaces for all the standard TripleO
#   network isolation networks.  This version will deploy duplicate
#   public network interfaces on the baremetal instances so that the
#   public network can be configured as a bond.
