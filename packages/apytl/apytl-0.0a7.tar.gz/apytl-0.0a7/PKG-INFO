        # Another Python Terminal Logger
        
        Here it is: another python terminal logger---apytl.
        
        This implementation uses only the standard Python library and supports unicode 
        emojis. If you've ever wanted a progress bar that fills with piles of poop, 
        eggplants, or extended middle fingers, then you're in the right place.
        
        # Installation
        ## `pip`
        I've attempted to make this easy. You should be able to use `pip` to install the 
        package by running:
        
        ```console
        pip install apytl
        ```
        
        Right now the package is only released for Python >=3.5. If `pip` complains 
        about not finding a version, you can either try upgrading Python, or build from 
        source.
        
        ## Building from source
        You may install from source by either downloading the files from PyPI 
        [(here)](https://pypi.org/project/apytl/#files) or cloning the git repository:
        
        ```console
        git clone https://github.com/anadolski/apytl.git
        ```
        
        If this is the first time you're installing the package, all you should need to 
        do is `cd` to the source directory (i.e., the one containing `setup.py`) and 
        run:
        
        ```console
        python setup.py build
        python setup.py install --user --record ./.installed_files.txt
        ```
        
        If you re-clone the repo (or `git pull` or otherwise update the source code), 
        you will need to reinstall to take advantage of all the fun new features. And 
        bugs. Let's not forget those bugs. To reinstall---again, from the source 
        directory---run:
        
        ```console
        rm $(cat ./.installed_files.txt)
        ```
        
        (Note: This command will attempt to delete every entry in 
        `.installed_files.txt`, so use with caution. Ensure there isn't anything 
        important hiding in that file.)
        
        To reinstall, simply run the `build` and `install` commands mentioned at the 
        beginning of the section.
        
        # Use
        You can use the progress bar for iteration tracking. All the function needs to 
        know is the total number of iterations in the loop, and the iteration that it is 
        currently on. Just drop the `apytl.Bar().drawbar()` function inside your loop 
        and pass it those parameters. Here's a minimal example:
        
        ```python
        import time
        import apytl
        
        total_iterations = 25
        wait = 0.1
        
        for index, value in enumerate(range(total_iterations)):
            # Your code goes here, then we draw the progress bar
            apytl.Bar().drawbar(value, total_iterations)
            time.sleep(wait)
        ```
        
        But you probably want emojis, so do this instead:
        
        ```python
        import time
        import apytl
        
        total_iterations = 25
        wait = 0.1
        
        for index, value in enumerate(range(total_iterations)):
            # Your code goes here, then we draw the progress bar
            apytl.Bar().drawbar(value, total_iterations, fill='poop')
            time.sleep(wait)
        ```
        
        Ta-da! Poop all over your terminal (assuming the combination of your display 
        manager, terminal emulator, and font supports it).
        
        `apytl.Bar().drawbar()` accepts some customization options; see the docstring 
        for complete details. Here are a couple highlights:
         * `fill`: takes arbitrary single-character alphanumeric input, or an arbitrary 
           Python-formatted unicode emoji (of the form `\\UXXXXXXXX` or `\\uXXXX`), or 
           one of a few preset options listed in the docstring.
         * `barsize`: takes an integer and sets the size of the filling region.
        
        # Development
        This package is an alpha release and under active development. That means that I 
        fix bugs and create new ones approximately whenever I feel like it.
        
        The `master` branch is the most stable version of the package, with primary 
        development happening on `dev`.
        
        Pull requests and issue tickets are both welcomed and encouraged. Please put 
        specific emoji requests into issue tickets (for now).
