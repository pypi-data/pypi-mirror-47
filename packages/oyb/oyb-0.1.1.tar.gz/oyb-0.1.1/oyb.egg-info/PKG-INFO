        ===
        
        Oy vey! So many orbit models. Here's another one.
        
        Largely based on Howard Curtis' excellent text, *Orbital Mechanics for
        Engineering Students*, second edition. Contains the minimum components needed to
        model and propagate restricted two-body orbits, with time values leveraging the
        core Python module *datetime*.
        
        Primary components (modules) of the package are as follows:
        
        anomaly
        -------
        
        Defines conversions between various anomalies.
        
        earth
        -----
        
        Defines earth parameters and key earth-specific calculations (ECF/ENU frame
        conversions, latitude/longitude, GMST, etc.).
        
        orb
        ---
        
        The heart of the *oyb* package; these module contents are imported with the top
        package-level *oyb* object. Contains orbital models and conversions.
        
        plot
        ----
        
        Contains various plotting methods (both main plot functions and their specific
        rendering and annotation behaviors) for Orbit-derived objects in 2d (i.e.,
        ground track) and 3d (i.e., orbital) plots.
        
        rot
        ---
        
        Defines vector rotation (lower case) and frame tranformations (upper case). Both
        transformations can be concatenated to be performed in right-to-left upon a
        given vector operator. Note that the *dot()* method must be used, since these
        functions return a 2d *numpy.array* object.
