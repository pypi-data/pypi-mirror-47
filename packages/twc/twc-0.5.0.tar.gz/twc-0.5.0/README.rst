Features
~~~~~~~~

* agendas - display several filters on a single screen simultaneously
  (influenced by `org-mode <https:orgmode.org>`_)
* create, modify, delete, annotate tasks
* autocomplete and tab-complete writing task descriptions, annotations, tags
  etc.
* task formatting (with HTML-like markup)

* search can be case-sensitive, case-insensitive or smart-case (case sensitivite
  only when there are upper case characters in searched term)

Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~

TWC works with a concept of "agendas" influenced and borrowed from the mighty
org-mode. Agenda is basically a view of several TaskWarrior filters (called
blocks) displayed on a single screen simultaneously. You can jump between
blocks and single tasks.

To add agenda, first create a configuration file inside
``~/.config/twc/config.py``. It is a regular Python file with exposed variable
``c`` which references a configuration object. You can add new blocks like that:

.. code:: python

    c.add_block(
        agenda='My Agenda',
        title='Next Tasks',
        filter='status:pending',
        sort='priority+,urgency-')

    c.add_block(
        agenda='My Agenda',
        title='Projects',
        filter='-WAITING and (+BLOCKING or +BLOCKED) and -INSTANCE',
        sort='project-,priority-,order+,urgency-',
        format='* {description}<info>{tags}</info>')

Style and colors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

TWC can be styled in any way you want. To change its colors use `c.set_style()`:

.. code:: python

    c.set_style('highlight', 'bg:ansiblue bold')
    c.set_style('error', 'fg:white bg:red')

Style examples:

- ``fg:white`` (white foreground, named color)
- ``bg:#000000`` (black background, hexadecimal notation)
- ``bold italic underline blink reverse hidden`` (supported style flags)

Any style name can be used in task formatting. Some interface elements however
use specific style names.

Task Format
~~~~~~~~~~~

Block's format (``format``) is a mix of `Python's string format
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/string.html#formatspec>`_ and HTML-like
markup.

You can use any TaskWarrior's attribute name as format's placeholder and it will
be displayed if present.

.. code:: html

    *<sr left=" ["> right="] ">{id}</sr>{description}

Some additional markup can be added to the tasks. The following tags are
available:

* ``<sr left="[", right="]>text</sr>``: surrounds text with *left* and *right*.
* ``<ind value="A">text</ind>``: if there is any text inside a tag, it will be
  replaced with *value*. It's particularily useful for indicating that some
  task's property is present, without displaying it (like long list of
  annotations):
  ``<sr left="[" right="]"><ind value="A">{annotations}</ind></sr>``

Key bindings
~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default you can navigate with arrows or vim-style ``j`` and ``k``. Exit TWC
with ``q``.

You can bind and unbind keys with ``c.bind(key, command)`` and
``c.unbind(key)``. Refer to `User Manual <https://mgoral.gitlab.io/twc/>`_ for
a list of commands and other default key bindings.

Status line
~~~~~~~~~~~

Bottom status line can display arbitrary informations and  is configurable by
two variables: ``statusleft`` and ``statusright``. They describe format similar
to the one described in `Task Format`_ The main difference is that task
attributes are referenced by ``{task.<attribute>}`` placeholder and that there
additional placeholders available.

.. code:: python

    c.set('statusleft', '{COMMAND} {task.id}')
    c.set('statusright', '<ind value=A>{task.annotations}</ind>')

Status line placeholders also include: ``taskrc``, ``command``, ``COMMAND``, 
``agenda.pos``, ``agenda.size``, ``agenda.ppos``.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

First, make sure that TaskWarrior is installed on your system. TaskWarrior is
packaged for most of Linux distributions. Please refer to TaskWarrior's
`documentation <https://taskwarrior.org/download/>`_ for details.

TWC is distributed via `pypi <https://pypi.org/project/twc/>`_. You can
install it with pip:

.. code::

    $ pip3 install --user twc

or with pip wrapper like `pipsi <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/pipsi>`_:

.. code::

    $ pipsi install --python python3 twc

TWC reads your ``taskrc``. It'll use the default one, which is usually located
in ``~/.taskrc``, but you can change it with ``-t`` switch:

.. code::

    $ twc -t ~/dotfiles/my_taskrc

Termux
~~~~~~

TWC works on `Termux <https://termux.com/>`_, although there's currently a `bug
<https://github.com/regebro/tzlocal/pull/55>`_ in tzlocal - a library
indirectly used by TWC to get local timezone information.

Before running TWC on Termux you have to export the following environment
variable:

.. code:: shell

    export TZ=$(getprop persist.sys.timezone)

Termux emulates scroll events as key presses. You can bind them for easier
navigation:

.. code:: python

    c.bind('right', 'next-agenda')
    c.bind('left', 'prev-agenda')
