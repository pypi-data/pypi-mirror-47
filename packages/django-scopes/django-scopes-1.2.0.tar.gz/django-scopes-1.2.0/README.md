Motivation
----------

Many of us use Django to build multi-tenant applications where every user only ever
gets access to a small, separated fraction of the data in our application, while
at the same time having *some* global functionality that makes separate databases per
client infeasible. While Django does a great job protecting us from building SQL
injection vulnerabilities and similar errors, Django can't protect us from logic
errors and one of the most dangerous types of security issues for multi-tenant
applications is that we leak data across tenants.

It's so easy to forget that one ``.filter`` call and it's hard to catch these errors
in both manual and automated testing, since you usually do not have a lot of clients
in your development setup. Leaving [radical, database-dependent ideas](https://github.com/bernardopires/django-tenant-schemas)
aside, there aren't many approaches available in the ecosystem to prevent these mistakes
from happening aside from rigorous code review.

We'd like to propose this module as a flexible line of defense. It is meant to have
little impact on your day-to-day work, but act as a safeguard in case you build a
faulty query.

Installation
------------

There's nothing required apart from a simple

	pip install django-scopes

Compatibility
-------------

This library is tested against **Python 3.5-3.7** and **Django 2.1-2.2**.

Usage
-----

Let's assume we have a multi-tenant blog application consisting of the three models ``Site``,
``Post``, and ``Comment``:

```python
from django.db import models

class Site(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(…)

class Post(models.Model):
	site = models.ForeignKey(Site, …)
	title = models.CharField(…)

class Comment(models.Model):
	post = models.ForeignKey(Post, …)
	text = models.CharField(…)
```

In this case, our application will probably be full of statements like
``Post.objects.filter(site=current_site)``, ``Comment.objects.filter(post__site=current_site)``,
or more complex when more flexible permission handling is involved. With django-scopes, we
engourage you to still write these queries with your custom permission-based filters, but
we add a custom model manager that has knowledge about posts and comments being part of a
tenant scope:

```python
from django_scopes import ScopedManager

class Post(models.Model):
	site = models.ForeignKey(Site, …)
	title = models.CharField(…)

	objects = ScopedManager(site='site')

class Comment(models.Model):
	post = models.ForeignKey(Post, …)
	text = models.CharField(…)

	objects = ScopedManager(site='post__site')
```

The keyword argument ``site`` defines the name of our **scope dimension**, while the string
``'site'`` or ``'post__site'`` tells us how we can look up the value for this scope dimension
in ORM queries.

You could have multi-dimensional scopes by passing multiple keyword arguments to
``ScopedManager``, e.g. ``ScopedManager(site='post__site', user='author')`` if that is
relevant to your usecase.

Now, with this custom manager, all queries are banned at first:

	>>> Comment.objects.all()
	ScopeError: A scope on dimension "site" needs to be active for this query.

The only thing that will work is ``Comment.objects.none()``, which is useful e.g. for Django
generic view definitions.

### Activate scopes in contexts

You can now use our context manager to specifically allow queries to a specific blogging site,
e.g.:

```python
from django_scopes import scope

with scope(site=current_site):
	Comment.objects.all()
```

This will *automatically* add a ``.filter(post__site=current_site)`` to all of your queries.
Again, we recommend that you *still* write them explicitly, but it is nice to know to have a
safeguard.

Of course, you can still explicitly enter a non-scoped context to access all the objects in your
system:

```python
with scope(site=None):
	Comment.objects.all()
```

This also works correctly nested within a previously defined scope. You can also activate multiple
values at once:

```python
with scope(site=[site1, site2]):
	Comment.objects.all()
```

Sounds cumbersome to put those ``with`` statements everywhere? Maybe not at all: You probably
already have a middleware that determines the site (or tenant, in general) for every request
based on URL or logged in user, and you can easily use it there to just automatically wrap
it around all your tenant-specific views.

Functions can opt out of this behavior by using

```python
from django_scopes import scopes_disabled


with scopes_disabled():
    …

# OR

@scopes_disabled()
def fun(…):
    …
```

### Custom manager classes

If you were already using a custom manager class, you can pass it to a `ScopedManager` with the `_manager_class`
keyword like this:
from django.db import models

```python
from django.db import models

class SiteManager(models.Manager):

	def get_queryset(self):
		return super().get_queryset().exclude(name__startswith='test')

class Site(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(…)

	objects = ScopedManager(site='site', _manager_class=SiteManager)
```

Caveats
-------

We want to enforce scoping by default to stay safe, which unfortunately
breaks the Django test runner as well as pytest-django. For now, we haven't found
a better solution than to monkeypatch it:

```python
from django.test import utils
from django_scopes import scopes_disabled

utils.setup_databases = scopes_disabled()(utils.setup_databases)
```

When using model forms, Django will automatically generate choice fields on foreign
keys and many-to-many fields. This won't work here, so we supply helper field
classes ``SafeModelChoiceField`` and ``SafeModelMultipleChoiceField`` that use an
empty queryset instead:

```python
from django.forms import ModelForm
from django_scopes.forms import SafeModelChoiceField

class PostMethodForm(ModelForm):
    class Meta:
        model = Comment
        field_classes = {
            'post': SafeModelChoiceField,
        }
```

We noticed that ``django-filter`` also runs some queries when generating filtersets.
Currently, our best workaround is this:

```python
from django_scopes import scopes_disabled

with scopes_disabled():
    class CommentFilter(FilterSet):
        …
```
