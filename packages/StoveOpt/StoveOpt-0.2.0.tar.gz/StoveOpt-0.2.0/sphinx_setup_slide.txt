code api is what sphuicn will automatically do
	-will read the docstrings

Users guide:
	-I think I write all of this in markdown or 


Us getting somethin strarted:


--need to manually commit to the documentation branch in github
doctr


--I am definitely going to need to go edit my docstring formats....


--create a docs BRANCH, and do the quickstart stuff while in that dir

in docs, make a file called installation.rst

--might have to install the make command

--after making, need to add to the index page html.

--in the conf.py that sphinx created--> extensions list-->this is where you would add the autodoc, napolean

----have to choose the false/true for the numpy or google style docstrings

looking at the actual html is in the docs>build> folder (click index)


--need "make"
process: commit current changes, mkdir docs, do the quickstart,

-for each of the modules, manually, need to create an rst in docs for each of the modules with the automodule command listed-->

like this:

===============
import_geometry
===============

.. automodule:: StoveOpt.import_geometry


need to manually add the rst files to the index in Contents:


intersphinx links to python/numpy documentation --> really helpful cool thing to add
