TESTS: There is a lot going on here


import_geometry to do:
	tst_locate_geometry --> This is for looking at various file entries to the input yaml file

	test_extract_geometry --> written but need to fix the path differences between the linux and windows OS
		This is a nightmare, still need to do this

	test_create_fuel_blocks is PASSING

	test_create_additional_front_points is PASSING

	test_points_to_strings is trivial I think.... If deemed necessary make sure that max length is 5, and all types are strings

	test_vertice_concatenate is pretty much the same logic as the previous
	
	test_create_back_points --> leaving alone for now...
		-put in a positive shift, and assert that shift remains negative
		-
