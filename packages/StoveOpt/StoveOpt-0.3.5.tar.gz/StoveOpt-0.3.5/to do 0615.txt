to do 6-15:


--Need to do the usage part -- figure out how to run the software (as module as in Niemeyer's example)

--make sure versions matchup (README says 0.3.3)

--verify in the theory section of README than the paper is linked correctly

--git ignore for proper structure

--packaging isn't complete: the requirements must need some additional packages

--there is a hard coded path in the modules somewhere, so the tests arent working as intended

--xlrd needs to be in the requirements file
