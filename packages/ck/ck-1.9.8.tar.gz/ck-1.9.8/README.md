CK is a portable and open-source framework to help you share your knowledge (data, models, code), 
best practices and repetitive and painful tasks in the form of automated and reusable Python components 
with a unified API, CLI, JSON meta description and connectors from C,C++,Fortran,
Java and other languages: see the [index of shared components](http://crowd-research.com/c.php).

Such components can be continuously improved by the community and connected together 
into portable and automated workflows to collaboratively solve real world problems: 

* Real world use cases: http://cKnowledge.org/partners
* FOSDEMâ€˜19 presentation: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.2556147
* Reproducible papers: http://crowd-research.com
* Discussion group: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/collective-knowledge
* Development: https://github.com/ctuning/ck

Note that CK is a collaborative project and not a magic ;) - if some third-party automation fails 
or misses some functionality (software detection, package installation, benchmarking and autotuning workflow, etc),
the CK concept is to continuously and collaboratively improve such reusable components!
