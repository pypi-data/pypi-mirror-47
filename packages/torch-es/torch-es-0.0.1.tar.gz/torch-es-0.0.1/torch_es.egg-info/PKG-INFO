Description: # torch-es
        Double Seasonal Exponential Smoothing using [`PyTorch`](https://pytorch.org) with batched data and multiple series training support.
        
        
        # ðŸ“‹ Roadmap
        
        There are lots of tools built on top of the code in this repository, so the plan is to add them here eventually.
        
        Here's what's published:
        
        - [x] 3d Holt-Winters implementation
        - [x] Additive and Multiplicative seasonalities
        - [x] Blender module to merge predictions from multiple series.
        - [ ] Training loop for normal and bptt training.
        - [ ] Uncertainty estimation via sampling.
        - [ ] Additional losses
        - [ ] RNN training on top of HW.
