This library is a fork of the `flask-oidc <https://github.com/puiterwijk/flask-oidc>` library, and should work with any standards compliant OpenID Connect provider.

The main contribution that this library provides compared to _flask_oidc_ is the option to locally validate JWT-based access tokens
(based on python-jwt and jwcrypto) instead of calling the OP's userinfo endpoint for validation.

It also provides a way of providing a factory function for _httplib2.Http_ instances, so that SSL certificate validation etc. can be customized properly.

It has been tested with:

* `Keycloak <https://www.keycloak.com/>`_
