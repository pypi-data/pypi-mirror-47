# PNMAC Secrets Manager Utility

[TOC]

## To Install

`pip install pnmac-aws-common`

## Secrets Manager

Used to fetch AWS secrets per the company's pattern for secrets management.

This code expects that a "secrets_path" is either provided to the function or established as an environment variable called "secrets_path".

It will try to get your secrets from manager.

Should you not have access to the secrets manager (for example, while during local development) environment variables are returned in that case. So simply add your secrets as environment variables to accomodate this case.

## SQS

A set of utilities to chunk data for queues. TODO: add a bit of logic that manages on body size to make sure we don't hit the 256kb limits.
