        High-performance signature computations in PyTorch, on both CPU and GPU, accelerated via C++ extensions, including backpropagation.
        
        What is the signature transform?
        --------------------------------
        If you're reading this documentation then it's probably because you already know what the signature transform is, and are looking to use it in your project. But in case you've stumbled across this and are curious what all the fuss is about...
        
        The 'signature transform' is a transformation that does a particularly good job extracting features from streams of data. Check out `this <https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.03788>`__ for a primer on its use in machine learning, as a feature transformation. Then have a look `here <https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.08494>`__ for a more in-depth look at building it into neural network models, as an arbitrary layer anywhere within a neural network. It's pretty cool.
        
        In brief: the signature of a path determines the path essentially uniquely, and does so in an efficient, computable way.  Furthermore, the signature is rich enough that every continuous function of the path may be approximated arbitrarily well by a linear function of its signature; it is what we call a ‘universal nonlinearity’. Now for various reasons this is a mathematical idealisation not borne out in practice (which is why we put them in a neural network and don't just use a simple linear model), but they still work very well!
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Install via ``pip``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            pip install signatory
        
        
        Alternatively install via ``git``:
        
        .. code-block:: bash
        
            git clone https://github.com/patrick-kidger/signatory.git
            cd signatory
            pip install .

        FAQ
        ---
        * What's the difference between ``signatory`` and `iisignature <https://github.com/bottler/iisignature>`__?
        
        The main difference is that ``iisignature`` is NumPy-based and CPU-only. Meanwhile ``signatory`` is for PyTorch and may also run on the GPU, as it is targeted towards machine learning applications. The two packages also use different embeddings from streams of data into path space -- see the next question.
        
        * Why is the signature of a path different when I use the `iisignature <https://github.com/bottler/iisignature>`__ package?
        
        The signature transform is defined on paths; given a stream of data we must decide how to embed it into a path. ``iisignature`` uses a piecewise linear embedding, whilst ``signatory`` uses a piecewise constant embedding. From a data science point of view, both are equally arbitrary -- so as long as you pick one and stick with it then it shouldn't matter.
        
        This embedding was selected for ``signatory`` because signature calculations for this embedding may be done much more rapidly, with provably fewer scalar multiplications. Empirically it runs 3-4 times faster on the CPU than ``iisignature`` on reasonably sized batches. (``signatory`` is optimised for batched operations, using batches to be `cache-friendly <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16699247/what-is-a-cache-friendly-code>`__.)
