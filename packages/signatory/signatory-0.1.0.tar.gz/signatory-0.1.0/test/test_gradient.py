# ...this doesn't even manage to start at all, because of the fact that 'grad' and 'y' are both lists of torch.Tensors.
# Looking at the source code for autograd.gradcheck, it's clear that they don't expect any nested data structures for
# input like this; all their code assumems that the inputs are just torch.Tensors.
# Since we need to have lists of Tensors as input to signature_backward, it seems plausible that the fact that their
# torch.autograd.gradgradcheck even runs is a fluke, and the fact that it then fails is meaningless. Especially when
# you consider that we haven't even written a custom double-backward function - double-backward is done automatically by
# autograd in its usual 'tracing' manner, so it would be very surprising if it didn't give the correct results.
