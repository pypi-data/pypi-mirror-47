Description: # Fortuna: Random Value Generator
        Fortuna's main goal is to provide a quick and easy way to build custom random-value generators for your data. While performance is not the primary focus, Fortuna is about an order of magnitude faster than the builtin Random module.
        
        The core functionality of Fortuna is based on the RNG Storm engine. While Storm is a high quality random engine, Fortuna is not appropriate for cryptography of any kind. Fortuna is meant for games, data science, A.I. and experimental programming, not security.
        
        Suggested Installation: `$ pip install Fortuna`
        
        Installation on platforms other than MacOS may require building from source files.

        #### Project Terminology:
        - Value: Any python object.
        - Callable: Any callable object, function, method or lambda.
        - Collection: A group of Values.
            - List, Tuple, Set, etc... Any object that can be converted into a list via `list(some_object)`.
            - Comprehensions that produce a Collection also qualify.
            - Fortuna classes that wrap a Collection can wrap a Collection, Sequence or generator.
            - Fortuna functions that take a Collection as input will always require a Sequence.
        - Sequence: An ordered Collection.
            - List, tuple or list comprehension.
            - A Sequence is an ordered Collection that can be indexed like a list, without conversion.
            - All Sequences are Collections but not all Collections are Sequences.
        - Pair: Collection of two Values.
        - Table: Collection of Pairs.
        - Matrix: Dictionary of Collections.
        - Inclusive Range.
            - `[1, 10] -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
        - Exclusive Range.
            - `(0, 11) -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
        - Partially Exclusive Range.
            - `[1, 11) -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
            - `(0, 10] -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10`
        - Automatic Flattening.
            - All Random Value Generators in Fortuna will recursively call or "flatten" callable objects returned from the data at call time.
            - Static objects and non-default callable objects will be returned in an uncalled state without error.
            - A callable that can be flattened is any class initializer, function, method or lambda so long as it requires no arguments, it will be automatically flattened.
            - Mixing callable objects with un-callable objects is fully supported, but it can look a bit messy at first.
            - Nested callable objects are fully supported. Because `lambda(lambda) -> lambda` fixes everything for arbitrary values of 'because', 'fixes' and 'everything'.
            - To disable automatic flattening, pass the optional keyword argument `flat=False`.
        
        
        ## Random Value Generators
        
        ### Fortuna.random_value
        `Fortuna.random_value(data: Sequence, flat=True) -> Value`
        Drop in replacement for Random.choice()
        - @param data :: Sequence of Values.
        - @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values.
        - @return Value :: Produces a random value from the list with a flat uniform distribution.
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import random_value
        
        
        apples = ["Delicious", "Honey Crisp", "Macintosh"]
        fruit = [
            lambda: f"Apple, {random_value(apples)}",
            "Banana",
            "Cherry",
            "Grapes",
            "Orange",
        ]
        apples.append("Granny Smith")  # Dynamic Modification
        print(random_value(fruit))  # prints a random fruit, see the distribution below.
        
        """
        >>> distribution_timer(random_value, fruit, label="random_value(fruit)")
        Output Analysis: random_value(fruit)
        Typical Timing: 219 ± 16 ns
        Distribution of 10000 Samples:
         Apple, Delicious: 5.13%
         Apple, Granny Smith: 4.93%
         Apple, Honey Crisp: 4.9%
         Apple, Macintosh: 4.86%
         Banana: 20.16%
         Cherry: 20.01%
         Grapes: 19.63%
         Orange: 20.38%
        """
        ```
        
        
        ### TruffleShuffle
        `Fortuna.TruffleShuffle(data: Collection, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
        - Non-destructive, copies the data once.
        - @param data :: Collection of Values. Set recommended.
        - @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values.
        - @return :: Callable Instance.
            - @return :: Random value from the list with a **Wide Uniform Distribution**. The average width of the output distribution will naturally scale up with the size of the set.
        
        **Wide Uniform Distribution**: *"Wide"* refers to the average distance between consecutive occurrences of the same value in the output sequence. The goal of this type of distribution is to keep the output sequence free of clumps or streaks of the same value, while maintaining randomness and uniform probability. This is not the same as a *flat uniform distribution*. The two distributions over time will be statistically similar for any given set, but the repetitiveness of the output sequence will be very different.
        
        #### TruffleShuffle, Basic Use
        ```python
        from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle
        
        
        list_of_values = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 }
        truffle_shuffle = TruffleShuffle(list_of_values)
        
        print(truffle_shuffle())  # will print one of the numbers 1-6
        
        for _ in range(100):
            assert truffle_shuffle() is not truffle_shuffle()  # will never fire, except for a set of one.
        ```
        
        #### TruffleShuffle with Flattening
        ```python
        from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle
        
        
        auto_flat = TruffleShuffle([lambda: 1, lambda: 2, lambda: 3])
        print(auto_flat())  # will print the value 1, 2 or 3.
        # Note: the lambda will not be called until call time and stays dynamic for the life of the object.
        
        un_flat = TruffleShuffle([lambda: 1, lambda: 2, lambda: 3], flat=False)
        print(un_flat()())  # will print the value 1, 2 or 3, mind the double-double parenthesis
        
        auto_un_flat = TruffleShuffle([lambda x: x, lambda x: x + 1, lambda x:  x + 2], flat=False)
        # Note: flat=False is not required here because the lambdas can not be called without input x satisfied.
        # It is still recommended to specify flat=False if non-flat output is intend.
        print(auto_un_flat()(1))  # will print the value 1, 2 or 3, mind the double-double parenthesis
        ```
        
        #### Mixing Static Objects with Callable Objects
        ```python
        from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle
        
        
        """ With automatic flattening active, lambda() -> int can be treated as an int. """
        mixed_flat = TruffleShuffle([1, 2, lambda: 3])
        print(mixed_flat())  # will print 1, 2 or 3
        
        mixed_un_flat = TruffleShuffle([1, 2, lambda: 3], flat=False) # this pattern is not recommended.
        print(mixed_flat())  # will print 1, 2 or "Function <lambda at some_address>"
        # This pattern is not recommended because you wont know the nature of what you get back.
        # This is almost always not what you want, and it can give rise to messy logic in other areas of your code.
        ```
        
        #### Dynamic Strings
        To successfully express a dynamic string, and keep it dynamic, at least one level of indirection is required. Without an indirection the f-string would collapse into a static string too soon.
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle, d
        
        
        # d() is a simple dice function, d(n) -> [1, n] flat uniform distribution.
        dynamic_string = TruffleShuffle((
            # while the probability of all A == all B == all C, individual probabilities of each possible string will differ based on the number of possible outputs of each category.
            lambda: f"A{d(2)}",  # -> A1 - A2, each are twice as likely as any particular B, and three times as likely as any C.
            lambda: f"B{d(4)}",  # -> B1 - B4, each are half as likely as any particular A, and 3/2 as likely as any C.
            lambda: f"C{d(6)}",  # -> C1 - C6, each are 1/3 as likely as any particular A and 2/3 as likely of any B.
        ))
        
        print(dynamic_string())  # prints a random dynamic string, flattened at call time.
        
        """
        >>> distribution_timer(dynamic_string)
        Output Analysis: TruffleShuffle(sequence_data)()
        Typical Timing: 875 ± 8 ns
        Distribution of 10000 Samples:
         A1: 16.9%
         A2: 16.43%
         B1: 8.39%
         B2: 8.21%
         B3: 8.28%
         B4: 8.46%
         C1: 5.25%
         C2: 6.09%
         C3: 5.59%
         C4: 5.32%
         C5: 5.41%
         C6: 5.67%
        """
        ```
        
        #### Nesting Dolls
        ```python
        from Fortuna import TruffleShuffle
        
        
        nesting_dolls = TruffleShuffle({
            TruffleShuffle({"A", "B", "C", "D", "E"}),
            TruffleShuffle({"F", "G", "H", "I", "J"}),
            TruffleShuffle({"K", "L", "M", "N", "O"}),
            TruffleShuffle({"P", "Q", "R", "S", "T"}),
        })
        
        print(nesting_dolls())  # prints one of the letters A-T, double wide distribution.
        ```
        
        ### QuantumMonty
        `Fortuna.QuantumMonty(data: Collection, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
        - @param data :: Collection of Values.
        - @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values.
        - @return :: Callable Object with Monty Methods for producing various distributions of the data.
            - @return :: Random value from the data. The instance will produce random values from the list using the selected distribution model or "monty". The default monty is the Quantum Monty Algorithm.
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import QuantumMonty
        
        
        list_of_values = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
        monty = QuantumMonty(list_of_values)
        
        print(monty())               # prints a random value from the list_of_values.
                                     # uses the default Quantum Monty Algorithm.
        
        print(monty.flat_uniform())  # prints a random value from the list_of_values.
                                     # uses the "uniform" monty: a flat uniform distribution.
                                     # equivalent to random.choice(list_of_values).
        ```
        The QuantumMonty class represents a diverse collection of strategies for producing random values from a sequence where the output distribution is based on the method you choose. Generally speaking, each value in the sequence will have a probability that is based on its position in the sequence. For example: the "front" monty produces random values where the beginning of the sequence is geometrically more common than the back. Given enough samples the "front" monty will always converge to a 45 degree slope down for any list of unique values.
        
        There are three primary method families: linear, gaussian, and poisson. Each family has three base methods; 'front', 'middle', 'back', plus a 'quantum' method that incorporates all three base methods. The quantum algorithms for each family produce distributions by overlapping the probability waves of the other methods in their family. The Quantum Monty Algorithm incorporates all nine base methods.
        
        ```python
        import Fortuna
        
        
        monty = Fortuna.QuantumMonty(
            ["Alpha", "Beta", "Delta", "Eta", "Gamma", "Kappa", "Zeta"]
        )
        
        # Each of the following methods will return a random value from the sequence.
        # Each method has its own unique distribution model for the same data set.
        
        """ Flat Base Case """

        ### Weighted Choice: Base Class
        Weighted Choice offers two strategies for selecting random values from a sequence where programmable rarity is desired. Both produce a custom distribution of values based on the weights of the values.
        
        The choice to use one strategy over the other is purely about which one suits you or your data best. Relative weights are easier to understand at a glance. However, many RPG Treasure Tables map rather nicely to a cumulative weighted strategy.
        
        #### Cumulative Weighted Choice
        `Fortuna.CumulativeWeightedChoice(weighted_table: Table, flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
        - @param weighted_table :: Table of weighted pairs.
        - @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values.
        - @return :: Callable Instance
            - @return :: Random value from the weighted_table, distribution based on the weights of the values.
        
        _Note: Logic dictates Cumulative Weights must be unique!_
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import CumulativeWeightedChoice
        
        
        cum_weighted_choice = CumulativeWeightedChoice([
            (7, "Apple"),
            (11, "Banana"),
            (13, "Cherry"),
            (23, "Grape"),
            (26, "Lime"),
            (30, "Orange"),  # same as relative weight 4 because 30 - 26 = 4
        ])
        
        print(cum_weighted_choice())  # prints a weighted random value
        ```
        
        #### Relative Weighted Choice
        `Fortuna.RelativeWeightedChoice(weighted_table: Table) -> Callable -> Value`
        - @param weighted_table :: Table of weighted pairs.
        - @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values.
        - @return :: Callable Instance
            - @return :: Random value from the weighted_table, distribution based on the weights of the values.
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import RelativeWeightedChoice
        
        
        population = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Grape", "Lime", "Orange"]
        rel_weights = [7, 4, 2, 10, 3, 4]
        rel_weighted_choice = RelativeWeightedChoice(zip(rel_weights, population))
        
        print(rel_weighted_choice())  # prints a weighted random value
        ```

        `Fortuna.FlexCat(dict_of_lists: Matrix, key_bias="front_linear", val_bias="truffle_shuffle", flat=True) -> Callable -> Value`
        - @param dict_of_lists :: Keyed Matrix of Value Sequences.
        - @parm key_bias :: String indicating the name of the algorithm to use for random key selection.
        - @parm val_bias :: String indicating the name of the algorithm to use for random value selection.
        - @param flat :: Bool. Default: True. Option to flatten callable values.
        - @return :: Callable Instance
            - @param cat_key :: Optional String. Default is None. Key selection by name. If specified, this will override the key_bias for a single call.
            - @return :: Value. Returns a random value generated with val_bias from a random sequence generated with key_bias.
        
        FlexCat is like a two dimensional QuantumMonty, or a QuantumMonty of QuantumMontys.
        
        The constructor takes two optional keyword arguments to specify the algorithms to be used to make random selections. The algorithm specified for selecting a key need not be the same as the one for selecting values. An optional key may be provided at call time to bypass the random key selection. Keys passed in this way must exactly match a key in the Matrix.
        
        By default, FlexCat will use key_bias="front_linear" and val_bias="truffle_shuffle", this will make the top of the data structure geometrically more common than the bottom and it will truffle shuffle the sequence values. This config is known as TopCat, it produces a descending-step, micro-shuffled distribution sequence. Many other combinations are available.

        ### Random Index, ZeroCool Specification
        ZeroCool Methods are used to generate random Sequence indices.
        
        ZeroCool methods must have the following properties:
        - Any distribution model is acceptable.
        - The method or function must take exactly one Integer parameter N.
        - The method returns a random int in range `[0, N)` for positive values of N.
        - The method returns a random int in range `[N, 0)` for negative values of N.
            - This symmetry matches how python can index a list from the back for negative index values or from the front for positive index values.
        
        ZeroCool functions often have an interesting limit as size goes to zero. ZeroCool does not place requirements the output of this input limit. At higher levels of abstraction, inside classes that employ ZeroCool methods- zero is always a sentinel to indicate the full range. In that case the length of the list is sent to the ZeroCool method, not zero. However for those who enjoy thinking a little deeper, consider the following:
        
        If given the fact that an empty range is never an option, we could design a better solution than failure for input zero. Calculus might suggest that both infinity and negative infinity are equally viable output for an input limit of zero, but both are inappropriate for indexing a list. However, if we map infinity to the back of the list and minus infinity to the front of the list, then the following might hold: `random_index(0) -> [-1, 0]`. This "Top or Bottom" solution is not required for a method to be ZeroCool compatible, it is just an interesting option. Other valid possibilities include: always return None or 0 or -1 or throw an exception or spawn nasal demons, however none of these seem terribly helpful or useful. At least the Top/Bottom solution accurately reflects the "off by one" symmetry of the domain mapping that defines ZeroCool methods in general.
        
        
        ```python
        from Fortuna import random_index
        
        
        some_list = [i for i in range(100)]
        
        print(some_list[random_index(10)])  # prints one of the first 10 items of some_list, [0, 9]
        print(some_list[random_index(-10)])  # prints one of the last 10 items of some_list, [90, 99]
