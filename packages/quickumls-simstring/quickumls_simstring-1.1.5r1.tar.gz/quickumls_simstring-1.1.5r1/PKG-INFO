        Windows/Anaconda/VisualStudio specific steps:
        
        1. Make sure that iconv is available to your desired conda environment:
           ``conda install -c conda-forge libiconv``
        2. Then, open a Visual Studio Developer Prompt (e.g. “VS 2015 x64
           Developer Command Prompt” or “VS 2015 x86 Developer Command Prompt”)
        3. Now you can any of these commands to build or install:
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           python setup.py build
           python setup.py install
        
        4. **NOTE**: If there is a failure that ‘rc.exe’ cannot be found, add
           the appropriate WindowKits binary path to PATH. More info on this
