Description: # ENABLE - ENhancement of Automated Blood fLow Estimates 
        
        ENABLE is a technique to evaulate image quality in multi-PLD ASL data. 
        
        *Shirzadi et al, "Enhancement of Automated Blood Flow Estimates (ENABLE) From
        Arterial Spin-Labelled MRI" J Magn Reson Imaging. 2017 Jul 6. doi: 10.1002/jmri.25807*
        
        ENABLE performs the following steps:
        
        1. A **preprocessing** step, consisting of tag/control differencing, brain 
        extraction, T1 co-registration and segmentation
        
        2. A **sorting** step in which quality measures are calculated for each 
        PLD image, namely:
          - Contrast:Noise ratio in GM (CNR)
          - Detectibility metric (DETECT, proportion of voxels with significantly greater than zero signal in GM)
          - Coefficient of variation of difference data (COV, spatial standard deviation divided by spatial mean in GM)
          - Temporal SNR (TSNR, spatial mean of ASL image divided by temporal STD image in GM)
        
        3. A **selection** step in which a combined quality measure is calculated and the best image is identified:
          - 0.1*CNR + 1.8*DETECT - COV - TSNR
         
        4. A *CBF generation* step in which a CBF image is generated from the best image
        
        ## Usage
        
            oxasl_enable -i <ASL input file> -t1 <T1 image> -n <Noise ROI image> -o <Output dir>
        
        oxasl_enable can also be used as a plug-in for the OXASL ASL processing pipeline - see documentation
