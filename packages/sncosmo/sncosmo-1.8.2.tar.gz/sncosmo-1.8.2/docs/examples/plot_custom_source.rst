===========================
Creating a new Source class
===========================

Extending sncosmo with a custom type of Source.

A ``Source`` is something that specifies a spectral timeseries as
a function of an arbitrary number of parameters. For example, the SALT2
model has three parameters (``x0``, ``x1`` and ``c``) that determine a
unique spectrum as a function of phase. The ``SALT2Source`` class implements
the behavior of the model: how the spectral time series depends on those
parameters.

If you have a spectral timeseries model that follows the behavior of one of
the existing classes, such as ``TimeSeriesSource``, great! There's no need to
write a custom class. However, suppose you want to implement a model that
has some new parameterization. In this case, you need a new class that
implements the behavior.

In this example, we implement a new type of source model. Our model is a linear
combination of two spectral time series, with a parameter ``w`` that
determines the relative weight of the models.



.. code-block:: python


    import numpy as np
    from scipy.interpolate import RectBivariateSpline
    import sncosmo


    class ComboSource(sncosmo.Source):

        _param_names = ['amplitude', 'w']
        param_names_latex = ['A', 'w']   # used in plotting display

        def __init__(self, phase, wave, flux1, flux2, name=None, version=None):
            self.name = name
            self.version = version
            self._phase = phase
            self._wave = wave

            # ensure that fluxes are on the same scale
            flux2 = flux1.max() / flux2.max() * flux2
        
            self._model_flux1 = RectBivariateSpline(phase, wave, flux1, kx=3, ky=3)
            self._model_flux2 = RectBivariateSpline(phase, wave, flux2, kx=3, ky=3)
            self._parameters = np.array([1., 0.5])  # initial parameters

        def _flux(self, phase, wave):
            amplitude, w = self._parameters
            return amplitude * ((1.0 - w) * self._model_flux1(phase, wave) +
                                w * self._model_flux2(phase, wave))








... and that's all that we need to define!: A couple class attributes
(``_param_names`` and ``param_names_latex``, an ``__init__`` method,
and a ``_flux`` method. The ``_flux`` method is guaranteed to be passed
numpy arrays for phase and wavelength.

We can now initialize an instance of this source from two spectral time
series:



.. code-block:: python


    #Just as an example, we'll use some undocumented functionality in
    # sncosmo to download the Nugent Ia and 2p templates. Don't rely on this
    # the `DATADIR` object, or these paths in your code though, as these are
    # subject to change between version of sncosmo!
    from sncosmo.builtins import DATADIR
    phase1, wave1, flux1 = sncosmo.read_griddata_ascii(
        DATADIR.abspath('models/nugent/sn1a_flux.v1.2.dat'))
    phase2, wave2, flux2 = sncosmo.read_griddata_ascii(
        DATADIR.abspath('models/nugent/sn2p_flux.v1.2.dat'))

    # In our __init__ method we defined above, the two fluxes need to be on
    # the same grid, so interpolate the second onto the first:
    flux2_interp = RectBivariateSpline(phase2, wave2, flux2)(phase1, wave1)

    source = ComboSource(phase1, wave1, flux1, flux2_interp, name='sn1a+sn2p')








We can get a summary of the Source we created:



.. code-block:: python


    print(source)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 Out:

 .. code-block:: none

    class      : ComboSource
    name       : 'sn1a+sn2p'
    version    : None
    phases     : [0, .., 90] days
    wavelengths: [1000, .., 25000] Angstroms
    parameters:
      amplitude = 1.0
      w         = 0.5


Get a spectrum at phase 10 for different parameters:



.. code-block:: python


    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

    wave = np.linspace(2000.0, 10000.0, 500)
    for w in (0.0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0):
        source.set(w=w)
        plt.plot(wave, source.flux(10., wave), label='w={:3.1f}'.format(w))

    plt.legend()
    plt.show()




.. image:: /examples/images/sphx_glr_plot_custom_source_001.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




The w=0 spectrum is that of the Ia model, the w=1 spectrum is that of
the IIp model, while intermediate spectra are weighted combinations.

We can even fit the model to some data!



.. code-block:: python


    model = sncosmo.Model(source=source)
    data = sncosmo.load_example_data()
    result, fitted_model = sncosmo.fit_lc(data, model,
                                          ['z', 't0', 'amplitude', 'w'],
                                          bounds={'z': (0.2, 1.0),
                                                  'w': (0.0, 1.0)})

    sncosmo.plot_lc(data, model=fitted_model, errors=result.errors)




.. image:: /examples/images/sphx_glr_plot_custom_source_002.png
    :class: sphx-glr-single-img




The fact that the fitted value of w is closer to 0 than 1 indicates that
the light curve looks more like the Ia template than the IIp template.
This is generally what we expected since the example data here was
generated from a Ia template (although not the Nugent template!).
