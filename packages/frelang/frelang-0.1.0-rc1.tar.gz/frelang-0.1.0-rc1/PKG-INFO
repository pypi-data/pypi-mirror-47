Description: Fre
        =========
        
        
        Short for
        
        * **F** lexible
        * **Re** adability,
        
        Fre is a simple, easily parseable and readable, but at the same time
        flexible, strong-typed, and interpreted programming language.
        
        Its original intent was to provide ZDoom (a game engine based on Doom)
        a language that could be parsed by its existing ZScript language. However,
        a Python VM/interpreter is also in the plans.
