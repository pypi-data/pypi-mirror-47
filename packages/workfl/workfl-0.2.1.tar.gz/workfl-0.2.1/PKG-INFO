        ## Introduction
        
        workfl is a lightweight markup language for simple workflow diagrams. It's designed to be quick to write and easy to read.
        
        Example:
        
        ```workfl
        A
        B
        D
        
        A
        C
        D
        ```
        
        ![Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Dullage/workfl/master/docs/example.png)
        
        You can try it out for yourself at [workfl.ws](https://workfl.ws).
        
        The workfl python package can convert workfl markup into dictionaries of nodes and connections. There is also a method to export the workflow into [mermaid](https://mermaidjs.github.io/) syntax.
        
        ## Installation
        
        `pip install workfl`
        
        ## Usage
        ```python
        import workfl
        
        markup = "A\nB"
        flow = workfl.ws(markup)
        
        print(flow.nodes)  # A dictionary of nodes
        print(flow.connections)  # A dictionary of connections
        
        mermaid = flow.to_mermaid()
        print(mermaid)
        ```
        
        By default `to_mermaid()` will render a chart flowing from Top to Bottom. This can be changed by declaring a `direction` e.g. `to_mermaid(direction="LR")` (Left to Right). There are 4 options:
        
        | Option | Direction |
        | -- | -- |
        | TB | Top to Bottom (Default) |
        | BT | Bottom to Top |
        | LR | Left to Right |
        | RL | Right to Left |
        
        ## Syntax
