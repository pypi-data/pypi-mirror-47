# VPoser: Variational Human Pose Prior
![alt text](github_data/vposer_samples.png "Interpolation of novel poses on the smoother VPoser latent space.")

## Description
Human joint configuration, also called as pose, is restricted by biomechanics of our body. 
Utilizing these constrains accuratly would be a corner stone of many computer vision tasks, 
such as estimating 3D human body parameters from 2D keypoints, detecting anomolies, and etc.

Here we present a method that is used in [SMPLify-X](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/). 
Our variational human pose prior, named as VPoser, has the following features: 
 - is end-to-end differentiable
 - provides a way to penalizes impossible poses while allowing possible ones
 - effectively considers interdependency of configurations of the joints
 - intorduces a more efficient, and lower dimensional representation for human pose
 - can be used as a generative source for data dependent tasks

## Installation

To install the model simply you can:
1. To install from PyPi simply run: 
  ```bash
  pip install human_body_prior
  ```
2. Clone this repository and install it using the *setup.py* script: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nghorbani/human_body_prior
python setup.py install
```

## Loading Trained Models

To download the *VPoser* trained models go to the [project website](https://smpl-x.is.tue.mpg.de/) and register to get access to the downloads section. Afterwards, you can follow [model loading tutorial](human_body_prior/tutorials/README.md) to load and use your trained models.

## Train VPoser
We train VPoser, using a [variational autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6114), 
which learns a latent representation of human pose and regularizes the distribution of the latent code to be a normal distribution.
We train our prior on the data released by [AMASS](https://amass.is.tue.mpg.de/), 
namely SMPL pose parameters of various publicly available human motion capture datasets. 
You can follow [data preparation tutorial](human_body_prior/data/README.md) to learn how to download and prepare AMASS for VPoser.
Afterwards, you can [Train VPoser from scratch](human_body_prior/train/README.md).
