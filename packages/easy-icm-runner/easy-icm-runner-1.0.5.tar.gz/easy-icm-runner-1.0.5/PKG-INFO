        ## Usage:
        This project can be used as a module within your custom program, or standalone from the command line.  Below we demonstrate sample usage:
        
        ### Python
        
        The snippet below demonstrates running a job _syncronously_ in python code.  Such a method will be desirable for secret and configuration management, or for integrating into a more complex application.
        ```python
        from icm_runner import Runner
        
        job_runner = Runner()
        
        job_runner.get_token(username='icm username', password='icm password')
        job_runner.run_process_by_name(model_name='model name', process_name='process name',follow=True)
        ```
        
        ### Command Line
        For those of you who are not budding pythonistas, or just looking for a simple solution to job scheduling we also allow a command line entrypoint.   
        ```text
        $ python icm_runner.py -u "icm username" -p "icm password" -m "model name" -j "process name"
        ```
