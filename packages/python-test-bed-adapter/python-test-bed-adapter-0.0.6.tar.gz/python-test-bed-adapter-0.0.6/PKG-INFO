Description: # python-test-bed-adapter
        
        This is the test-bed adapter for Python: it allows you to easily connect Python 
        services to the Apache Kafka test-bed via Python. Although it is specifically 
        created for connecting to our [test-bed](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/test-bed), 
        it should work for any Apache Kafka version too.
        
        The implementation is a wrapper around [Pykafka](https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka) 
        and [avro-python3](https://avro.apache.org/docs/1.8.2/gettingstartedpython.html) 
        offering support for:
        - AVRO schema's and messages: both key's and values should have a schema 
        as explained [here](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/avro-schemas).
        - Kafka consumer and producer for the test-bed topics.
        - Management
          - Heartbeat (topic: connect-status-heartbeat), so you know which clients are online.
          Each time the test-bed-adapter is executed, it starts a heartbeat process to notify
          the its activity to other clients.
          - Configuration (topic: connect-status-configuration), so you can see which 
          topics clients consume and produce.
        
        ## Installation
        You need to install [Python 3+](https://www.python.org/). 
        
        To install the [PYPI](https://pypi.org/project/python-test-bed-adapter/) package run
         ```pip3 install python-test-bed-adapter```
        
        ### Using the Github repo
        If you clone the Github repository, to run the examples you will need to install the dependencies
        specified on the file 
        [requirements.txt](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/python-test-bed-adapter/blob/master/requirements.txt)
         For that, run
         ```pip3 install -r requirements.txt```
         from the project folder.
         ## Examples and usage
         Check the examples of [consumer](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/python-test-bed-adapter/blob/master/examples/consumer_example.py)
         and [producer](https://github.com/DRIVER-EU/python-test-bed-adapter/blob/master/examples/producer_example.py).
