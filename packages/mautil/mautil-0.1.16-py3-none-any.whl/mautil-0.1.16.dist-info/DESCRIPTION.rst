# mautil
An deep learning util based on tensroflow 

# Tested on tensorflow 1.11

# Install
`pip install mautil`

# Demo
## There are two text style transfer models. CA is an implementation of the  paper  [Style Transfer from Non-Parallel Text byCross-Alignment](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7259-style-transfer-from-non-parallel-text-by-cross-alignment.pdf). CAR model just use reinforcement learning to bypass gumbel softmax
## run the text style transfer model in debug mode
`python train.py -m CAR -dataset yelp -d`
