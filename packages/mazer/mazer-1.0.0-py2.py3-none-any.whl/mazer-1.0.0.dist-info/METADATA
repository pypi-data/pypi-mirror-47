Mazer

Ansible content manager

A new command-line tool for managing `Ansible <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`__ content.

Expect breaking changes!
------------------------

Mazer is experimental, and currently only available for tech-preview. Use with lots of caution! It is not intended for use in
production environments, nor is it currently intended to replace the `ansible-galaxy` command-line tool.

If you're installing Ansible content in a production environment, or need assistance with Ansible, please visit the `Ansible Project <https://github.com/ansible/ansible>`__,
or the `Ansible docs site <https://docs.ansible.com>`__.

Origin of "Mazer"
-----------------

The name Mazer comes from a character from Ender's Game, Mazer Rackham, that Wikipedia describes as "the half-Māori captain who singlehandedly stopped the Second Invasion by realizing that the Buggers are a hive mind. Due to his inability to pass on his knowledge, he was forced to spend fifty years at relativistic speeds (eight years to Rackham) so that he could train the next commander — Ender Wiggin."

A mazer is also a hardwood drinking vessel.

0.5.0 (2019-04-15)
------------------

* WARNING: Mazer now requires a Ansible Galaxy server that provides the 'v2' style REST API.
  At time of release, that includes galaxy-dev.ansible.com and galaxy-qa.ansible.com
* WARNING: Support for directly installing 'traditional' style roles from Ansible Galaxy
  is no longer supported. ie, 'mazer install geerlingguy.ntp' will no longer work.
  However, roles can still be installed if they are included in a collection
* WARNING: The config file items and cli options for specifying install paths
           have changed and may break existing configs and scripts.
* The cli option '--content-root' is now '--collections-path'
* The short cli option '-C' is now shorthand for '--collections-path' instead
  of '--content-root'
* The config item 'content_root' has been replaced with 'collections_path'
* The config item 'global_content_root' has been replaced with 'global_collections_path'
* The new 'collections_path' value no longer needs to end with 'ansible_collections'
* The new 'global_collections_path' value no longer needs to end with 'ansible_collections'
* The new 'collections_path' defaults to '~/.ansible/collections'.
  Note that this replaces the previous 'content_root' config item that
  defaulted to '~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections'
* The new 'global_collections_path' defaults to '/usr/share/ansible/collections'.
  Note that this replaces the previous 'global_content_root' config item that
  defaulted to '/usr/share/ansible/collections/ansible_collections'
* 'mazer install' with default 'collections_path' ('~/.ansible/collections') will
  still install to '~/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections', but install
  will add the require trailing 'ansible_collections' automatically.
* 'mazer install --global' with default 'globale_collections_path'
  ('/usr/share/ansible/collections') will still install to
  '/usr/share/ansible/collections/ansible_collections', but
  'install --global' will add the require trailing
  'ansible_collections' automatically.
* The REST API client now uses 'requests' python module instead of the 'url' module bundle from ansible.
* Add cli '--config' option to specify a path to an alternative config file.
* Add support for 'MAZER_HOME' environment variable. MAZER_HOME defaults to ~/.ansible and
  specifies where mazer looks for it's config (mazer.yml and mazer-logging.yml)
* `216 Use Galaxy REST API v2 <https://github.com/ansible/mazer/issues/216>`_.
* `239 Rename content-root to collections-path to be consistent with ansible <https://github.com/ansible/mazer/issues/239>`_.

* `186 Implement 'migrate_role' command to convert traditional roles to collections <https://github.com/ansible/mazer/issues/186>`_.

  collection and the value is a https://github.com/rbarrois/python-semanticversion version spec
