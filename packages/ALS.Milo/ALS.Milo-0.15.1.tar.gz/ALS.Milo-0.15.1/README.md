# ALS.Milo (version 0.15)

Overview
---
_**Milo**_ is a suite of Python modules used to read, process, and analyze 
data that was collected on the **Scattering Chamber** located at 
**Beamline 4.0.2** (_a.k.a. **BL402**_) of the **Advanced Light Source** 
(Berkeley, CA USA).

It is distributed under the _namespace package_, _**ALS**_. 

Installation
---
### Install from PyPI
**_ALS.Milo_** can be installed from PyPI using `pip`.
The following example shows how.
```bash
>> sudo pip install ALS.Milo
```
### Install from local repository (download)
**_ALS.Milo_** can be installed from a local copy of the project repository 
using `pip`. The following example shows how.
```bash
>> cd ALS.Milo-0.15.1/  # Local directory of project repository
>> sudo pip install .
```

Background information
---
Data from the BL402 Scattering Chamber is stored in two types of files:
* **FITS files**: Each image captured by the CCD (_a.k.a._ the camera) is 
stored in a separate file using the _FITS_ format. _More details below._
https://fits.gsfc.nasa.gov/fits_documentation.html
* **Scan summary files**: When a scan sequence is run to collect data, a text 
file is created to summarize the parameters of the scan and the data collected.

   Every _scan summary file_ contains a header that describes the scan and the 
types of data recorded, followed by data rows -- one row per data point. An 
_Instrument Scan_ provides an _image filename_ in each data row that can be 
used to access the CCD images recorded during the scan.

Usage
---
`class CcdImageFromFITS` encapsulates the operations of loading CCD data 
from a FITS file (including header information), accessing that data, and 
converting CCD screen coordinates (pixels) into reciprocal space coordinates.

The following command can be used 
to access the `CcdImageFromFITS` class in the `qimage` module.
```python
from als.milo.qimage import CcdImageFromFITS
```

To read a FITS file use the constructor:  
`CcdImageFromFITS(`*`filename`*`)` ,  
where _filename_ is a reachable (relative or absolute) file path to the FITS 
file.

The two-dimensional array of data can be accessed through the instance member, 
`data`.
```python
ccd_image = CcdImageFromFITS("NiFe_8044-00024.fits")
ccd_image.data  # 2D array with shape (num_rows, num_columns)
```

Reciprocal space coordinates are calculated for each pixel using the member 
function, `qvalues_df()`. The return value is a PANDAS dataframe (_df_) where 
each row corresponds to a single pixel. The columns `["Qx", "Qy", "Qz"]` are 
the diffractometer coordinates of the reciprocal space vector in units of 
nm<sup>-1</sup> (_Q_ = 2&pi; / _d_). Intensity of each pixel is in column, 
`"Counts"`.
```
ccd_image = CcdImageFromFITS("NiFe_8044-00024.fits")
q_ccd_df = ccd_image.qvalues_df()
q_ccd_df["Qx", "Qy", "Qz", "Counts"]    # CCD data in reciprocal space
```
