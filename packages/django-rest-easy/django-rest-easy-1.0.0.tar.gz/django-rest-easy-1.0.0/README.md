django-rest-easy
================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/bujniewicz/django-rest-easy.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/bujniewicz/django-rest-easy)

Django-rest-easy is an extension to Django Rest Framework providing quality of life improvements to serializers and views
that introduce a more coherent workflow for creating REST APIs:

* Versioning and referencing serializers by model and schema, along with autoimport, so your serializers will be available anywhere,
  as long as you know the model and schema.
* A `StaticField` for adding static data (independent of instance) to serializers.
* Creating views and viewsets using model and schema (it will automatically obtain serializer and queryset, although you can override
  both with usual DRF class-level parameters).
* A serializer override for a particular DRF verb, like create or update: no manual get_serializer_class override, no splitting ViewSets
  into multiple views.
* Scoping views\' and viewsets\' querysets by url kwargs or request object parameters. Fore example, when you want to limit messages to
  a particular thread or threads to currently logged in user.
* Adding your own base classes to `GenericView` and your own mixins to all resulting generic view classes, like `ListCreateAPIView`.
* Chaining views\' `perform_update` and `perform_create`: they by default pass \*\*kwargs to `serializer.save()` now.
* A helper mixin that enables serializing Django model instances with just an instance method call.
* A set of helper methods that find serializer class and deserialize a blob of data, since oftentimes you will not know what exact data you will
  receive in a particular endpoint, especially when dealing with complex integrations.

All of the above are possible in pure DRF, but usually introduce a lot of boilerplate or aren\'t very easy or straightforward to code.
Therefore, at Telmediq we decided to open source the package that helps make our API code cleaner and more concise.

### Basic usage

```python
from django.conf.urls import include, url
from rest_framework.routers import DefaultRouter

from rest_easy.serializers import ModelSerializer
from rest_easy.views import ModelViewSet
from rest_easy.scopes import UrlKwargScopeQuerySet
from rest_easy.tests.models import Account, User

class UserSerializer(ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model = User
        schema = 'default'
        fields = '__all__'

class UserViewSet(ModelViewSet):
    model = User
    schema = 'default'
    lookup_url_kwarg = 'pk'
    scope = UrlKwargScopeQuerySet(Account)

router = DefaultRouter()
router.register(r'accounts/(?P<account_pk>\d+)/users', UserViewSet)

urlpatterns = [url(r'^', include(router.urls))]
```

Installation
------------
`pip install django-rest-easy` and add rest_easy to installed apps in Django settings:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = (
    # ...
    'rest_framework',
    'rest_easy',
    # ...
)
```

The settings used are:

* REST_EASY_AUTOIMPORT_SERIALIZERS_FROM - specify modules or packages that rest-easy will try to import serializers
  from when AppConfig is ready. The import is app-based, so it will search for serializers in all installed apps.
  By default `['serializers']` 
* REST_EASY_VIEW_BASES - your mixins that should go into all views near the end of the mro (before all DRF and
  django-rest-easy's bases, after all generic mixins from DRF). 
* REST_EASY_GENERIC_VIEW_MIXINS - your mixins that should go into all generic views at the beginning of the mro
  (that means CreateAPIView, ListAPIView, RetrieveAPIView, DestroyAPIView,  UpdateAPIView,  ListCreateAPIView,
  RetrieveUpdateAPIView, RetrieveDestroyAPIView, RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView, ReadOnlyModelViewSet,
  ModelViewSet).
* REST_EASY_SERIALIZER_CONFLICT_POLICY - either 'allow' or 'raise'. What should happen when you redeclare a serializer
  with same model and schema - either the new one will be used or an error will be raised. By default 'allow' to not
  break applications with weird imports.

Feel free to browse the code and especially the tests to see what's going on behind the scenes.

Contributions
-------------

Please read CONTRIBUTORS file before submitting a pull request.

We use Travis CI. The targets are 10.00 for lint and non-decreasing coverage (currently at 100%), as well as
building sphinx docs.

You can also check the build manually, just make sure to `pip install -r requirements.txt` before:

```
pylint rest_easy --rcfile=.pylintrc
coverage run --source=rest_easy -m rest_easy.runtests && coverage report -m
cd docs && make html
```

Additionally you can check cyclomatic complexity and maintenance index with radon:

```
radon cc rest_easy
radon mi rest_easy
```

The target is A for maintenance index, B for cyclomatic complexity - but don't worry if it isn't met, I can
refactor it after merging.
