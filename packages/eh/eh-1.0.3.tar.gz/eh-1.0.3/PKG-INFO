Description: [//]: # (eh, help)
        #Eh
        
        Eh is a tool to give quick help on a particular subject
        
        The source code can be found at:
        
        ```
        https://github.com/roaet/eh
        ```
        
        ##Installing
        
        Install with `pip install eh`. You may want to use `sudo` if you want it
        available everywhere.
        
        With some versions of linux it will install it into `~/.local/bin` when you
        do not use `sudo`. Ensure that this directory is in your `PATH` if you want to
        run eh.
        
        ##Making an eh topic
        
        You can make a new eh topic by:
        
        - contributing to the subject repo at `https://github.com/roaet/eh_subjects`
        
        ##Future features
        
        - Bash-completion for subjects at command line
        - Config from home for color options
        - Personal subject repositories
