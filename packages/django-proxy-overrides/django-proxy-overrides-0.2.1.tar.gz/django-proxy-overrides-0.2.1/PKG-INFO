Description: Allow overriding foreign key fields on Proxy models.
        
        Mostly, you won't want to do this. However, I did have a situation where it would
        be useful, mainly for reducing the numbers of queries I was having to run.
        
        You can read about it at: http://schinckel.net/2015/05/13/django-proxy-model-relations/
        
        
        Usage is pretty simple:
        
        .. code-block :: python
        
            from proxy_overrides.related import ProxyForeignKey
        
            class ProxyModel(ParentModel):
                related = ProxyForeignKey(OtherProxyModel)
        
        You may only override fields that exist, although in the future, it may be possible to create a relation with a different name (enabling you to keep the standard relation to the non-proxy model).
        
        You may also only override with a compatible field (and only one proxy model may point to any other given proxy model).
        
        
        It is also possible to override non-related models, but I'm not that interested in that use case at the moment.
