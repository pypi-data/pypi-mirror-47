Overview
--------

The Umm al-Qura calendar is the lunar Hijri (Islamic) calendar officially
adopted by Saudi Arabia for administrative purposes. It is mainly used by the
government, including its health care and education systems, in which almost
all documents and transactions are dated by the Hijri calendar.

However, the Gregorian calendar is the calendar used in most of the world,
and it has been implemented as the default calendar in nearly every computer
and database.

Therefore, a valid converter between Hijri and Gregorian dates is a necessity,
especially when conducting research, analyzing data, or building applications
that may have Hijri dates. Even though similar packages exist and try to fill
the gap, `Hijri Converter <https://github.com/dralshehri/hijri-converter>`__
comes with a pythonic code, more accuracy, and better performance.

Features
--------

- Accurate and reliable conversion.
- Complete alignment with the official calendar.
- Optimized code performance compared to similar packages.
- Intuitive, clean, and easy-to-use interface.
- Most of methods and formats are similar to those of standard library.
- Multilingual representation of weekday names, months, and calendar notations.
- Easily extendable to support other natural languages.
- Rich comparison between dates.
- Validation of input dates.
- Works on Python 3.6+ with zero dependencies.
- Thoroughly tested on all supported python versions.
