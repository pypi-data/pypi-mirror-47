Description: # singer-runner
        
        Singer Runner manages tap and target processes, as well as metrics, state, and configuration.
        
        ## Features
        - Run a tap or target
        - Pass run options via CLI paramters or JSON/YAML config file.
        - Use local file system or S3 for piping the singer stream, storing state, and storing metrics.
        - Metric storage, piping, and state storage can be extended / customized by inheriting from the base classes.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Requires python 3, tested with python 3.7

        ```
        
        ## Concepts
        
        - Pipes
           - Pipes move a stream of [Singer messages](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SPEC.md#output) from tap to target. A pipe could be as simple as a local file, a file in S3, or Kafka.
        - State Storage
        	- Loads/saves the [state JSON](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/CONFIG_AND_STATE.md#state-file).
        - Metrics Storage
           - Accepts a stream of [Singer Metrics](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/docs/SYNC_MODE.md#metric-messages)
        
           
        ## Programmatic Usage
        
        Singer runner can be used within any python application. The primary functions are in `singer_runner.runner` including:
        - `run_tap` runs a tap
        - `run_target` runs a target
        
        Classes in the `singer_runner.metrics`, `singer_runner.pipes`, and `singer_runner.state` can be used as arguemnts, along with catalog/config.
