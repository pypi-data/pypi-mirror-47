Description: # Cape
        
        **Cape** () is a system for explaining outliers (surprisingly low or high) aggregation function results for group-by queries in SQL. The user provides the system with a query and a surprising outcome for this query. Cape uses patterns discovered the describe trends that hold in the data in aggregation to explain such outliers.
        
        # Installation
        
        Cape requires python 3. Install with pip:
        
        ~~~shell
        pip install capexplain
        ~~~
        
        Install from github
        
        ~~~shell
        git clone git@github.com:IITDBGroup/cape.git capexplain
        cd capexplain
        python3 setup.py install
        ~~~
        
        # Usage
        
        Cape provides a single binary `capexplain` that support multiple subcommands. The general form is:
        
        ~~~shell
        capexplain COMMAND [OPTIONS]
        ~~~
        
        Options are specific to each subcommand. Use `capexplain help` to see a list of supported commands and `capexplain help COMMAND` get more detailed help for a subcommand.
        
        ## Overview
        
        Cape currently only supports PostgreSQL as a backend database. To use Cape to explain an aggregation outlier, you first have to let cape find patterns for the table over which are you are aggregating. This an offline step that only has to be executed once for each table (unless you want to rerun pattern mining with different parameter settings).
        
        ## Mining Patterns
        
        Use `capexplain mine [OPTIONS]` to mine patterns. Cape will store the discovered patterns in the database.
        
        ## Explaining Outliers
        
        To explain an aggregation outlier use `capexplain explain [OPTIONS]`.
