# pyPhenology  
pyPheonology is a software package for building plant phenology models. It has
numpy at itâ€™s core, making model building and prediction extremely fast. The
core code was written to model phenology observations from the National
Phenology Network, where abundant species have several thousand observations.
The API is inspired by scikit-learn, so all models can work interchangeably
with the same code. pyPhenology is currently used to build the continental
scale phenology forecasts on http://phenology.naturecast.org
