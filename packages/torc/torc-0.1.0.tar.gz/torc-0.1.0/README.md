# torc

Torc is a Python library for computing magnetic fields resulting from magnetic coils
such as loops, lines, round coils and racetrack coils, positioned and oriented
arbitrarily in space.

Documentation and examples yet to come, but there is one example file you can run:
```python
python -m torc.example
```

to display a simple racetrack coil

## Requirements

Requires `numpy` and `scipy`. '`mayavi` is an optional requirement, it is needed for
displaying 3D renderings of the magnetic coils.


## Installation

From pip: `pip install torc`
From source: Clone this repository and tun `python setup.py install`
