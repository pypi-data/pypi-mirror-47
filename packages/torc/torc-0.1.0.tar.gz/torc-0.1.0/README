Torc is a Python library for computing magnetic fields resulting from
magnetic coils such as loops, lines, round coils and racetrack coils,
positioned and oriented arbitrarily in space.

Documentation and examples yet to come, but there is one example file
you can run:

.. code:: python

   python -m torc.example

to display a simple racetrack coil

Requirements
------------

Requires ``numpy`` and ``scipy``. â€™\ ``mayavi`` is an optional
requirement, it is needed for displaying 3D renderings of the magnetic
coils.

Installation
------------

From pip: ``pip install torc`` From source: Clone this repository and
tun ``python setup.py install``
