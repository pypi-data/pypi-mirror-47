================
Edit attachments
================

This module adds a button on the records' attachment dropdown that allows to
open the attachment's form in edit mode. This makes it convenient to edit the
attachment's properties after upload.

On the attachment's form, a field is added to move the attachment to another
record.

Usage
=====

Click the pencil that appears next to the delete button when you hover over
an attachment in order to edit it.

To change the resource the attachment belongs to, edit the field `Resource
reference`.
