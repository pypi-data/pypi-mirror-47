================================

.. todo:: 

   - (!) Replace static flat in Ks by one with P0-90 inserted
   - (!) Combine data of different OB's with automatic selection of correct center, sky and flux images
   - (!) Add ADI (including PCA) of total intensity images for pupil-tracking observations
   - (!) Change config file option skip_preprocessing to perform_preprocessing: True/False, perform_polarimetry: True/False and perform_adi: True/False
   - (!) Add option to express final images in contrast/arcsec^2 or mJansky/arcsec^2
   - (!) Add plot of center coordinates of center frames vs time
   - (!) Test polarimetric data with dithering applied (e.g. centering methods, subtraction of object file from center file)
   - (!) Add model correction for narrowband filters
   - (!) Add option to apply accurate plate scale and distortion correction for data (especially important for pupil-tracking and bright sources; do we need calibrations?)	
      
   - (?) Add images and plots aimed at analysis of polarimetric data (R^2 scaling, AoLP arrows in polarized intensity or DoLP images, contrast curves etc.)	
   - (?) Add option to subtract DARK,BACKGROUND-frames if sky files are lacking (especially important for Ks; test effect first before completely implementing)
   - (?) Add option for 'stupid ADI' for field-tracking data with derotator offset and option to subtract 180 deg rotated image if no derotator offset
   - (?) Add warning if (part of the) data is taken at a low polarimetric efficiency, and perhaps make plot of efficiency vs file number
   - (?) Add optional ADI (including PCA) for polarization images	
   - (?) Add options for various methods to shift and rotate images (interpolate, ndimage-fourier, sci-image functions; similar to VIP)
   - (?) When rotating images, make complete frame still visible to not cut out any parts of the data
   - (?) Improve centering of non-coronagraphic data (center found depends a lot on first PSF and affects Qphi and Uphi images)
   - (?) Test finding of satellite spots of center files when waffle pattern is '+'
   - (?) Add weighted least-squares as option for model correction (depending on image quality or polarimetric efficiency)	
   - (?) Add multiprocessing for sigma filtering and centering of frames
   - (?) Make IRDAP runable from a script by importing it and calling main function
   - (?) Add option to scale the master sky frame to subtract from the object frames (especially for Ks; see also Gallicher et al. 2011)
   - (?) Exclude saturated pixels in aperture to determine star polarization (same way as used in function fit_2d_gaussian)
   - (?) Determine star polarization as a function of aperture radius	
   - (?) Add optional RDI for total intensity images	
   - (?) Make docstrings compliant with accepted conventions and create API doc on website

v0.1.2 June 2019, R.G. van Holstein:
 - Release of IRDAP package on PyPI and GitHub
 - Documentation put online
