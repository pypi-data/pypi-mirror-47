Sawx -- Simple Application-framework for wxPython
==============================================================



Abstract
========

This is a simple application framework system for wxPython, providing a multi-
tabbed, multi-frame environment with simple-to-understand support for dynamic
menubars, toolbars, and popup menus. Also includes many small utilities and
convenience classes, such as a tile layout control that can replace more complicated controls like the wx.aui.AuiManager.
