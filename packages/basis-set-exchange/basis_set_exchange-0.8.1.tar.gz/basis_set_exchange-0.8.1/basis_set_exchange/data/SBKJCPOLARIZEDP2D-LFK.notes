This small ECP basis set was designed to calculate molecular electronic
properties.  The SBKJC basis functions describe the valence (n-31) orbitals,
which are augmented by polarizing functions heavily influenced in number
and type by Sadlej's all-electron pVTZ basis set.  These functions were
optmized to reproduce atomic polarizabilities.  Other notes:  The H and
He -31 valence description is from the Binkley et. al. 3-21G basis set.
The [s,2p] augmentation was optimized analogously to the [p,2d] of the main
group elements.  Contraction coefficients of the original SBKJC basis were
altered for the elements Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs.
