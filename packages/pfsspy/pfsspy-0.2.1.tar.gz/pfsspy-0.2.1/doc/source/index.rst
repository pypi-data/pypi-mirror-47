pfsspy is a python package for carrying out Potential Field Source Surface
modelling. For more information on the actually PFSS calculation see
`this document <https://github.com/antyeates1983/pfss/blob/master/pfss-manual.pdf>`_.

.. note::

  pfsspy is a very new package, so elements of the API are liable to change with
  the first few releases.
  If you find any bugs or have any suggestions for improvement, please raise
  an issue here: https://github.com/dstansby/pfsspy/issues

Installing
----------

pfsspy can be installed from PyPi using

.. code::

    pip install pfsspy

Improving performance
---------------------

pfsspy automatically detects an installation of
`numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_, which compiles
some of the numerical code to speed up pfss calculations. To enable this
simply `install numba <http://numba.pydata.org/numba-doc/latest/user/installing.html>`_
and use pfsspy as normal.
