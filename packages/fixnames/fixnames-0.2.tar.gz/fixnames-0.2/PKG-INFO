Description: # Introduction
        *fixnames* is a utility to scan and fix linux filenames with special characters by renaming them.
        
        # Synopsis
        
        Linux is liberal in letting us choose filenames, so sometimes we end up choosing files with special characters such as `|, [, ], etc`. When you try to use these files on other operating systems like Windows or Android, they fail to work properly. `fixnames` is a Python utility to scan and fix such files on your linux system. `fixnames` scans files recursively in a given directory and fixes them by renaming if found to contain special chars.

        # Notes
        
        According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename#Comparison_of_filename_limitations), these are the special characters which aren't allowed on NTFS file systems:
        
        	0x00-0x1F 0x7F " * / : < > ? \ |
