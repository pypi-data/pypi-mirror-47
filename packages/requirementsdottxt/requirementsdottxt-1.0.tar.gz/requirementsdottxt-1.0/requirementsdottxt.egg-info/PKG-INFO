Description: #Ever typed `pip install requirements.txt` (and forgot the `-r`?)
        Never again! Now it just works(tm).
        
        #How it works:
        Forks from a post-install hook, runs `pip install --user -r requirements.txt` from the previous directory (which hopefully is the one from where pip was called) and uninstalls itself so this package can be used multiple times.
        
        ##This is probably not all that safe. More of a proof of concept/joke, not really intended to be used
