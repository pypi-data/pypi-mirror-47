Description: ## AWS SNS Construct Library
        
        Add an SNS Topic to your stack:
        
        ```ts
        import sns = require('@aws-cdk/aws-sns');
        
        const topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'Topic', {
            displayName: 'Customer subscription topic'
        });
        ```
        
        ### Subscriptions
        
        Various subscriptions can be added to the topic by calling the `.subscribeXxx()` methods on the
        topic.
        
        Add an HTTPS Subscription to your topic:
        
        ```ts
        const myTopic = new sns.Topic(this, 'MyTopic');
        
        myTopic.subscribeUrl('MyHttpsSubscription', 'https://foobar.com/');
        ```
        
        Subscribe a queue to the topic:
        
        ```ts
            const topic = new sns.Topic(this, 'MyTopic');
            const queue = new sqs.Queue(this, 'MyQueue');
        
            topic.subscribeQueue(queue);
        ```
        
        Note that subscriptions of queues in different accounts need to be manually confirmed by
        reading the initial message from the queue and visiting the link found in it.
        
        ### CloudWatch Event Rule Target
        
        SNS topics can be used as targets for CloudWatch event rules.
        
        Use the `@aws-cdk/aws-events-targets.SnsTopicTarget`:
        
        ```ts
        import targets = require('@aws-cdk/aws-events-targets');
        
        codeCommitRepository.onCommit(new targets.SnsTopicTarget(myTopic));
        ```
        
        This will result in adding a target to the event rule and will also modify the
        topic resource policy to allow CloudWatch events to publish to the topic.
