CustomDocs
----------

This package simply defines a few classes for parsing
source code of different comment styles.

This currently supports a style for
`shell scripts <https://cms-comp-ops-tools.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7/developer.html#shell-script-documentation>`_
through the ``customdocs.ShellScriptAnalyzer`` class and for
`Perl's POD <https://cms-comp-ops-tools.readthedocs.io/en/v0.7/developer.html#perl-script-documentation>`_
through ``customdocs.PODAnalyzer``.
