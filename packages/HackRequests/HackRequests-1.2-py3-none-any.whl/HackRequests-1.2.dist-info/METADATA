HackRequests is an HTTP network library for hackers. Based on python3.x. If you need a less bulky and like requests design, and provide the request/response package to facilitate your next analysis, if you use the Burp Suite, you can copy and replay the original message directly, and for a large number of HTTP requests, the HackRequests's threadpool can help you implement the quickest response.
