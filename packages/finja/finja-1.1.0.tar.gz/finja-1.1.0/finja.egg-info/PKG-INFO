Description: =====
        Finja
        =====
        
        An awesome hack. Your friendly finding ninja.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        Index and find your stuff.
        
        Index the current directory.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja --index
        
        Find huhu in the index.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja huhu
        
        Update outdated files and find huhu in the index.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja -u huhu
        
        Also works from a subdirectory.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja --index
           cd subdir
           finja huhu
        
        Tip: If you are sure that your system survives till everything is indexed use
        eatmydata.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           eatmydata finja -i
        
        Raw mode is meant for machines, but you can replace the \\0 with colons.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja -r huhu | finjacol
        
        Get reduplicated raw human readable output.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja -r stuff | finjadup | finjacol
        
        Get reduplicated raw output.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja -r stuff | finjadup
        
        Index git files only.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           git ls-tree -r --name-only master > FINJA.lst
           finja -i
        
        Filter unwanted output by path.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja -p spamfolder gold
        
        Cleanup free (unused) tokens and rebuild the database.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja --vacuum
        
        If there are some badly formatted files that seriously cramp your style.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           finja readlines for | cut -c -`tput cols`
        
        Index stuff in read-only directories.
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           mkdir sysinclude
           cd sysinclude
           find /usr/include/ -xdev > FINJA.lst
           eatmydata finja -i
           finja AF_INET6
        
        Caveat: We do not support languages that don't do spaces nor interpunct. Hey we
        are not google!
        
        Using in vim/neovim:
        
        * Install https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim
        
        * Create a finjaack script
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           #!/bin/sh
        
           finja -r "$@" | finjagrep
        
        * Set finjaack as ackprg
        
        .. code:: vim
        
           let g:ackprg = 'finjack'
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        .. code:: bash
        
           pip install -U finja
        
        
        Why?
        ====
        
        Unlike many of the great alternatives to finja, finja is generic. It doesn't
        know what it is indexing. Finja achieves good indexing quality by doing multiple
        passes with different tokenization methods and splitting character lists.
        Therefore it is slower and has a bigger index than non-generic indexers, but it
        just indexes your stuff and won't miss any files it doesn't know about.
        
        Finja is doing something wrong, can I customize the settings?
        =============================================================
        
        We would like to keep settings to a minimum. At the moment there is only
        international interpunct, that can be switched on. Please open an issue on Github
        and describe your problem, we will try to find a generic solution. If we don't
        find such a solution we might add a setting.
