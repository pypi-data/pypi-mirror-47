Description: ************
        Introduction
        ************
        This is the Traffic Ops Python Client for Python 2.x and Python 3.x.
        
        .. attention:: Traffic Control version 3.0.0 officially deprecates Python 2.x support. Starting with Traffic Control version 4.0.0, Python 2.x support will be dropped, and only Python 3.x will be supported. Users and developers are encouraged to switch to Python 3 as soon as possible.
        
        .. note:: This client has only been tested against Python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.6. Other versions may or may not work.
        
        Installation
        ============
        The official installation method is to use ``pip`` to install directly from from GitHub.
        
        Local Installation
        ------------------
        The preferred method is to use ``pip`` to install locally. Starting from the repository's root directory, the following script should do the job:
        
        The local installation method requires ``pip`` and ``setuptools``. ``setuptools`` should be installed if your system has ``pip``, but if you are missing either of them they can both be relatively easily installed with Python standard libraries.
        
        Development Dependencies
        ------------------------
        To install the development dependencies, first ensure that your system has ``pip`` and ``setuptools`` then use ``pip`` to install the development environment.
