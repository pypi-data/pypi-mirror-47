# Syntactic Tagger

The Syntactic Tagger is a part-of-speech tagger that uses a lexicon extracted from an electronic dictionary and a plain text corpus to tag texts.

The Syntactic Tagger works for Spanish, as it has taken the information from the Diccionario de la Real Academia Espa√±ola and the Spanish Wikipedia.
