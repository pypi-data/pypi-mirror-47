=================================
Account Fiscal Position VAT Check
=================================

With this module, when a user tries to validate a customer invoice or refund
with a fiscal position that requires VAT, Odoo block the validation of the invoice
if the customer doesn't have a VAT number in Odoo.

In the European Union (EU), when an EU company sends an invoice to
another EU company in another country, it can invoice without VAT
(most of the time) but the VAT number of the customer must be displayed
on the invoice.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, go to *Accounting > Configuration > Accounting
> Fiscal Positions* and enable the option **VAT Required** on the relevant
fiscal positions.

Usage
=====

On the customer form view, Odoo will display a warning when a user sets
a fiscal position that has the option **VAT Required** on a customer
that doesn't have a VAT number yet.
