        ### Baybars
        #### Raison D'Ãªtre: 
          - Common library that are wrappers on other third party libraries to make life easier for engineers.
          - We want better API's to interact various infrastructure, common libraries to be more productive.
          - We also want to share the code so that other people can reuse and make use of it. 
        
        Software is meant to be used and not forgotten.
        
        #### Features
        It has great wrappers(beautiful APIs to interact with) for:
          - Nomad(consul, vault)
          - Azure(blob, queue, cosmosdb)
          - Kafka
          - FTP
          - Various image processing utils 
          - Various compression utils
          - Various logging and timestamp utils
        
        #### Upcoming
        - [ ] Documentation
        - [ ] Tests for each modules and test coverage
        - Machine Learning Models(expect some good Tensorflow production ready models)
        - Some common preprocessing, feature extraction modules for various data
