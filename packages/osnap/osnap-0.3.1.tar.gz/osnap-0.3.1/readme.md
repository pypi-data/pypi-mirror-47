Introduction
------------

`OSNAP` is a way to deliver self-contained Python applications to end
users for Windows and OSX/MacOS. This process is known as freezing and
installing. Examples include delivering Python applications to Windows
PCs (both laptops and desktops), MacBooks, and iMacs.

Now on PyPI: `pip install osnap`
