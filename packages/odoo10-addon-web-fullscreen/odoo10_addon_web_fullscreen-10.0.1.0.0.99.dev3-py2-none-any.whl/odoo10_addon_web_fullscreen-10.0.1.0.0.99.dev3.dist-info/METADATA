==========
Fullscreen
==========

Adds a fullscreen mode button that toggles the primary
and secondary menu.

**NB:** This module will be less useful if *web_responsive* module is installed
since it contains the functionality described above. The major reason why this
module was ported from `8 <https://github.com/onesteinbv/addons-onestein/tree/8.0/web_fullscreen>`_ to 10 is because, it targets the traditional GUI and
just adds a small fullscreen button on views, in order to see more clearly on
small screens.
