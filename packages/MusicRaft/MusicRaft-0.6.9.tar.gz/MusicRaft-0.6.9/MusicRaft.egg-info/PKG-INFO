Description: MusicRaft
        =========
        
        'MusicRaft' is an GUI for the ABC(plus) music notation. Its implementation went through a few incarnations:
        
         Musicraft is built around PySide. It is in fact a very lightweight (and very limited!) IDE
         implemented as 'the raft' on top of which the plugin 'abcraft' is created.

        A separate plugin 'pyraft' supports editing of python3 source files. When a python script writes output with an HTML header,
        pyraft dsiplays the HTML in a special 'Html' tab within  the display notebook.
