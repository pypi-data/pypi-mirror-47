Try PIV parameters
==================

The asynchronous PIV topology is not very convenient to look for the best
parameters for a PIV computation. It is better to use the PIV work directly as
in these examples:

.. literalinclude:: piv_try_params.py

This other example includes a simple image-to-image preprocessing.

.. literalinclude:: piv_try_params_with_im2im_preproc.py
