PIV computation on a cluster 
============================

This minimal example presents how to carry out a simple PIV computation on a
cluster. We need a script for the computation and a script to submit the job.

We call the script for the computation ``piv_complete.py``. For idempotent job,
it is important to set ``params.saving.how = 'complete'``.

.. literalinclude:: piv_complete.py

The submission script is quite simple:

.. literalinclude:: submit_job_legi.py
