Overview of the organization of the package
===========================================

Data objects (:mod:`fluidimage.data_objects`)
---------------------------------------------

FluidImage uses data objects. These objects represent particular types of
data. They should be able to be loaded from a file, saved into a file,
displayed to the screen, etc.

Works (:mod:`fluidimage.works`)
-------------------------------

A work is a function processing input data and potentially returning input
data. Some works are actually classes which have to be initialized with
parameters.

For example, the work :class:`fluidimage.works.piv.multipass.WorkPIV` provide a
method Ì€``calcul(couple)`` which compute a PIV field from a couple of arrays.

The works are defined in the package :mod:`fluidimage.works`. Internally, the
works use utilities for processing defined in the package
:mod:`fluidimage.calcul`.

Topologies, waiting queues and executors
----------------------------------------

A **computational topology** contains the description of an asynchronous
computation as a graph made of **waiting queues** and **works**. The base class
:class:`fluidimage.topologies.base.TopologyBase` provides the methods
`add_queue` and `add_work` to define the topology.

The topology classes are defined in the package :mod:`fluidimage.topologies`.

The execution of a topology is done by an **executor**. Executor classes are
defined in the package :mod:`fluidimage.executors`. The executor organizes the
asynchronous calls of the work units of the topology with the correct transfer
of data between them.
