            :alt: Documentation Status
        
        Python module to interface to `Keepa <https://keepa.com/>`_ to query for Amazon product information and history.
        
        Documentation can be found on readthedocs at `keepaAPI <https://keepaapi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.
        
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        Module is compatible with Python 2 and 3. keepaAPI requires:
        
         - ``numpy``
         - ``requests``
        
        Product history can be plotted from the raw data when ``matplotlib`` is installed.
        
        Interfacing with the ``keepaAPI`` requires an accesskey and a monthly subscription from `keepa <https://keepa.com/#!api>`_
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        Module can be installed from PyPi using ``pip install keepaAPI``
        
        Source code can also be downloaded from `GitHub <https://github.com/akaszynski/keepaAPI>`_ and installed using ``python setup.py install`` or ``pip install .``
        
        
        Brief Example
        -------------
        .. code:: python
        
            import keepaAPI
            accesskey = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' # enter real access key here
            api = keepaAPI.API(accesskey)
        
            # Single ASIN query
            products = api.query('B0088PUEPK') # returns list of product data
        
            # Plot result (requires matplotlib)
            keepaAPI.PlotProduct(products[0])

        Detailed Example
        ----------------
        
        Import interface and establish connection to server
        
        .. code:: python
        
            import keepaAPI
            accesskey = 'XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX' # enter real access key here
            api = keepaAPI.API(accesskey)
        
        Single ASIN query
        
        .. code:: python
        
            products = api.query('059035342X')
        
            # See help(api.query) for available options when querying the API
        
        Multiple ASIN query from List
        
        .. code:: python
        
            asins = ['0022841350', '0022841369', '0022841369', '0022841369']
            products = api.query(asins)
        
        Multiple ASIN query from numpy array
        
        .. code:: python
        
            asins = np.asarray(['0022841350', '0022841369', '0022841369', '0022841369'])
            products = api.query(asins)
        
        Products is a list of product data with one entry per successful result from the Keepa server. Each entry is a dictionary containing the same product data available from `Amazon <http://www.amazon.com>`_.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # Available keys
            print(products[0].keys())
        
            # Print ASIN and title
            print('ASIN is ' + products[0]['asin'])
            print('Title is ' + products[0]['title'])
        
        The raw data is contained within each product result. Raw data is stored as a dictonary with each key paired with its associated time history.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # Access new price history and associated time data
            newprice = products[0]['data']['NEW']
            newpricetime = products[0]['data']['NEW_time']
        
            # Can be plotted with matplotlib using:
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            plt.step(newpricetime, newprice, where='pre')
        
            # Keys can be listed by
            print(products[0]['data'].keys())
        
        The product history can also be plotted from the module if ``matplotlib`` is installed
        
        .. code:: python
        
            keepaAPI.PlotProduct(products[0])
        
        You can obtain the offers history for an ASIN (or multiple ASINs) using the ``offers`` parameter.  See the documentation at `Request Products <https://keepa.com/#!discuss/t/request-products/110/1>`_ for further details.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            products = api.query(asins, offers=20)
            product = products[0]
            offers = product['offers']
        
            # each offer contains the price history of each offer
            offer = offers[0]
            csv = offer['offerCSV']
        
            # convert these values to numpy arrays
            times, prices = convert_offer_history(csv)
        
            # for a list of active offers, see
            indices = product['liveOffersOrder']
        
            # with this you can loop through active offers:
            indices = product['liveOffersOrder']
            offer_times = []
            offer_prices = []
            for index in indices:
                csv = offers[index]['offerCSV']
                times, prices = keepaAPI.convert_offer_history(csv)
                offer_times.append(times)
                offer_prices.append(prices)
        
            # you can aggregrate these using np.hstack or plot at the history individually
            import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
            for i in range(len(offer_prices)):
                plt.step(offer_times[i], offer_prices[i])
            plt.show()
