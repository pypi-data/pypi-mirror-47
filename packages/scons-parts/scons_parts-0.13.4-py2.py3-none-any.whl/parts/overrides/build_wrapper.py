# this overide deals with allowing Parts to record what targets file a given Parts/component
# will create. It also adds support for the generic allow_duplicate value for all builders
# which allows a builder call that is called twice and that build the same target for different
# environments to ignore that one set was built, avoiding the warning or error from SCons about
# building duplicate files. This is nice for copying config files that are platform independent
# during a cross build.


# I could try to turn the key into a string however i was unsure of speed impact..
# deal with that latter
