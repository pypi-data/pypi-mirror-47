        nbpages provides a command line tool for managing a github repository of Jupyter notebooks. The project was
        inspired by the tools included with the
        [Python Data Science Handbook](https://github.com/jakevdp/PythonDataScienceHandbook) by
        [Jake Vanderplas](https://github.com/jakevdp).
        
        ## Installation
        
            pip install nbpages
        
        To upgrade a previously installed version to the latest version
        
            pip install nbpages --upgrade
        
        ## Initial Setup
        
        This package assumes you have created a public github repository containing one or more Jupyter notebooks (*.ipynb) in a
        subdirectory named `notebooks`. The initial setup is performed with the command
        
            nbpages --setup
        
        This creates a directory named `templates` if needed with configuration data found in the `.git` subdirectory. If not
        already present, Jinja templates `README.md.jinja` and `notebook_header.jinja` are created. These templates should be
        edited as required.
        
        ## Normal Usage
        
        Notebooks filenames are prefixed with `nn.mm-` where`nn` refers to the chapter number or, if a letter, to an Appendix.
        mm` refers to the section number. Section `00` the chapter title and any prefatory material.
        
        To use, execute the command line
        
            nbpages
        
        from the top level directory of the notebook repository. The command will add or amend headers and navigation bars in
        all notebooks, and create a table of contents and a keyword index accessible from README.md and the navigation bars.
        
        ## Utilities
        
        To help achieve a consistent style over a collection of notebooks, use the command
        
            nbpages --lint
        
        to locate some forms of notebook 'lint'.  A current list of additional features can be found
        
            nbpages --help
