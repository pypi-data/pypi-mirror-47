Description: # mworks
        
        The goal of this project is to remove some boilerplate and add few standard
        routes to flask applications.
        
        ## Usage
        
        Add common routes to the flask application:
        
        ```python
        from mworks import CommonRoutes
        from flask import Flask
        
        app = Flask(__name__)
        mworks = CommonRoutes(app)
        ```
        
        ## Features
        
        CommonRoutes has the following endpoints implemented:
        
        - `/healthz` - Always returns HTTP 200, useful for healthchecks
        - `/varz` - Get variables for service monitoring. Customizable.
        - `/docz` - Read README.md from the application and render it.
        - `/logz` - Render logs from the application in the browser.
