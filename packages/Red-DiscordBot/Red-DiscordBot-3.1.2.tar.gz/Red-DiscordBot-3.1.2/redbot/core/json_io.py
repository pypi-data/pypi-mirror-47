        This fsync stuff here is entirely neccessary. 
        
        On windows, it is not available in entirety.
        If a windows user ends up with tons of temp files, they should consider hosting on
        something POSIX compatible, or using the mongo backend instead.

        Most users wont encounter this issue, but with high write volumes, 
        without the fsync on both the temp file, and after the replace on the directory,
        There's no real durability or atomicity guarantee from the filesystem.
