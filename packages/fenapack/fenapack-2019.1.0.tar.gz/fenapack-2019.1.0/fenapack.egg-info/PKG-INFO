        FENaPack is a package implementing preconditioners for Navier-Stokes
        problem using FEniCS and PETSc packages. In particular, variants of PCD
        (pressure-convection-diffussion) preconditioner from [1]_, [2]_ are
        implemented.

        Usage
        =====
        
        To use FENaPack matching version of FEniCS (version 2019.1.0)
        compiled with PETSc, petsc4py and mpi4py is needed. Note that
        FENaPack uses same version numbering as FEniCS and follows
        its release schedule with a short lag.
        
        To install FENaPack from source do::
        
          pip3 install [--user|--prefix=...] [-e] .
        
        in the source/repository root dir.  Editable install using ``-e``
        allows to use FENaPack directly from source directory while
        editing it which is suitable for development.
        
        You can install latest FENaPack release form PyPI::
        
          pip3 install [--user|--prefix=...] fenapack
        
        or install latest development version from Github::
        
          pip3 install [--user|--prefix=...] git+https://github.com/blechta/fenapack
        
        To start experimenting::
        
          cd demo/navier-stokes-pcd
          python3 demo_navier-stokes-pcd.py --help
          python3 demo_navier-stokes-pcd.py [opts]
          mpirun -n 16 python3 demo_navier-stokes-pcd.py [opts]
