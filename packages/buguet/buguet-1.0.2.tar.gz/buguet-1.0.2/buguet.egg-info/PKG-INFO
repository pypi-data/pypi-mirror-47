Description: # Buguet
        
        Ethereum Debugger (for smart contracts in Solidity).
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        python3
        
        Ethereum node running in archive mode with debug api. E.g. geth:
        ```
          geth --rpc --rpcapi eth,debug --gcmode archive
        ```
        By default localhost:8545 endpoint is used.
        
        Compiled contracts in format produced by `solc` with `--combined-json` option.
        Each contract called in transaction should be compiled with the same solidity
        version as it deployed on the blockchain (multiple versions can be used for one transaction).
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```
        pip install buguet
        ```
        
        ### Usage
