QCircuits is a lightweight Python package for simulating the operation of
small-scale quantum computers, based on the
`quantum circuit model <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit>`_.
It uses type (`d`, 0) and type (`d`, `d`) tensors to represent state vectors
for and operators on `d`-qubit systems,
rather than using straight vectors and matrices
produced by Kronecker products, as is more typical.

Quantum teleportation example:

Quantum circuit:

    :scale: 50%

Code::

    import qcircuits as qc

    # Instantiating the operators we will need
    CNOT = qc.CNOT()
    H = qc.Hadamard()
    X = qc.PauliX()
    Z = qc.PauliZ()

    # Alice's hidden state, that she wishes to transport to Bob.
    alice = qc.qubit(theta=1, phi=1, global_phase=0.2)

    # A previously prepared Bell state, with one qubit owned by
    # alice, and another by Bob, now physically separated.
    bell_state = qc.bell_state(0, 0)

    # The state vector for the whole system.
    phi = alice * bell_state

    # Alice applies a CNOT gate to her two qubit, and then
    # a Hadamard gate to her private qubit.
    phi = CNOT(phi, qubit_indices=[0, 1])
    phi = H(phi, qubit_indices=[0])

    # Alice measures the first two bits, and transmits the classical
    # bits to Bob.
    # The only uncollapsed part of the state vector is Bob's.
    M1, M2 = phi.measure(qubit_indices=[0, 1], remove=True)

    # Apply X and/or Z gates to third qubit depending on measurements
    if M2:
        print('First bit 1, applying X\n')
        phi = X(phi)
    if M1:
        print('Second bit 1, applying Z\n')
        phi = Z(phi)

    print('Original state:', alice)
    print('\nTeleported state:', phi)
