# Word Vector Embedding Package

**wordvecpy** is a library for processing text data, tokenizing it, and building word vector dictionaries and whole word vector embeddings from the corpus text.

**TextProcessor** takes a corpus of unprocessed text and processes it for use with word vectors.  Punctuation, stopwords, substitutions, contractions, and lemmatization can all be customized.

**VectorDictionary** loads pretrained word embeddings from .txt files so they can be used with other classes.  Every class in this package that requires a vector dictionary can take a pymagnitude vector or a VectorDictionary object.

**Vectokenizer** and **FastVectokenizer** both convert processed text corpus into integer embeddings and create vector dictionaries for those associated integer embeddings.  Both classes do the exact same thing but FastVectokenizer requires Keras to create integer embeddings and Vectokenizer does not.

**EmbeddedCorpus** and **LoadEmbeddedCorpus** generate (and save, if needed) and load complete word vector embeddings.  As these can take up a huge amount of memory quickly, it is capable of splitting and saving in slices of data.  This is most useful for using word vector embeddings in raw form.

**ELMOEmbeddedCorpus** does the exact same thing as **EmbeddedCorpus**, however, only for ELMO vectors.  Due to embeddings being different depending on the sentence for ELMO embeddings, the method for converting these had to be changed.  Embeddings are still loaded with **LoadEmbeddedCorpus**.  **ELMOEmbeddedCorpus** is currently only available using **pymagnitude** to access ELMO embeddings.

Current version is 0.6.
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install wordvecpy.

```bash
pip install wordvecpy
```

## Usage


## Future Plans

Currently working on functionality to reduce the size of integer embeddings by clustering words based on their vector representations.  This will hopefully allow smaller vector dictionaries to be used while maintaining good functionality.
