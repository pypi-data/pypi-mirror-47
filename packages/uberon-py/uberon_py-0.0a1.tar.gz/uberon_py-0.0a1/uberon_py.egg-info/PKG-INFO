Description: # `uberon-py`: a python package for the Uberon ontology
        :construction: :construction: This package is under development (particularly the documentation) :construction: :construction: 
        
        ## Summary
        I created this package to be able to easily interrogate relationships between Uberon terms in Python. 
        
        ## Usage
        Example usage:
        ```
        # read an ontology in obo format
        obo = uberon-py.Obo('path_to_file/uberon_ext.obo')
        
        # find relationships between terms of interest:
        # (in this case, are any of the source_terms, is_a or part_of the brain?)
        source_terms = ['UBERON:0003290','UBERON:0003369','UBERON:0003703'] 
        target_terms = ['UBERON:0000955'] #  brain term
        relations_of_interest  = 'is_a','part_of']
        relations = uberon-py.Relations(source_terms,target_terms,relations_of_interest[,obo.ont).relations
        
        ```
