# Random Number Generator: RNG Storm Engine

Python API for the C++ Random library.

**RNG is not suitable for cryptography, but it could be perfect for other random stuff like data science, experimental programming, A.I. and games.**


*Recommended Installation:* `$ pip install RNG`

    - @return :: random Float in range {0.0, 1.0} biclusive. The spec defines the output range to be [0.0, 1.0).
        - biclusive: feature/bug rendering the exclusivity of this function a bit more mysterious than desired. This is a known compiler bug.

- `lognormvariate(log_mean: float, log_deviation: float) -> float`
    - @param log_mean :: sets the log of the mean of the function.
    - @param log_deviation :: log of the standard deviation. Specifies spread of data from the mean.
- `exponential(lambda_rate: float) -> float`
    - Produces random non-negative floating-point values, distributed according to probability density function.
    - @param lambda_rate :: λ constant rate of a random event per unit of time/distance.
    - @return :: The time/distance until the next random event. For example, this distribution describes the time between the clicks of a Geiger counter or the distance between point mutations in a DNA strand.
- `gammavariate(shape: float, scale: float) -> float`
    - Generalization of the exponential distribution.

    - @return :: the sum of α independent exponentially distributed random variables, each of which has a mean of β.
- `weibullvariate(shape: float, scale: float) -> float`
    - Generalization of the exponential distribution.
    - Similar to the gamma distribution but uses a closed form distribution function.
    - Popular in reliability and survival analysis.
- `extreme_value(location: float, scale: float) -> float`
    - Based on Extreme Value Theory. 
    - Used for statistical models of the magnitude of earthquakes and volcanoes.
- `chi_squared(degrees_of_freedom: float) -> float`
    - Used with the Chi Squared Test and Null Hypotheses to test if sample data fits an expected distribution.
- `cauchy(location: float, scale: float) -> float`
    - @param location :: It specifies the location of the peak. The default value is 0.0.
    - @param scale :: It represents the half-width at half-maximum. The default value is 1.0.
    - @return :: Continuous Distribution.
- `fisher_f(degrees_of_freedom_1: float, degrees_of_freedom_2: float) -> float`
    - F distributions often arise when comparing ratios of variances.
- `student_t(degrees_of_freedom: float) -> float`
    - T distribution. Same as a normal distribution except it uses the sample standard deviation rather than the population standard deviation.
    - As degrees_of_freedom goes to infinity it converges with the normal distribution.


#### Engines
