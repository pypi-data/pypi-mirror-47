Sample config file::

    database:
        username: "OGROUCH"
        password: "SECR3TPASSWORD"
        sysdba: "n"
        host: >
                (DESCRIPTION =
                        (ADDRESS = (PROTOCOL = TCP)
                                   (HOST = servername.myschool.edu)
                                   (PORT = 1521)
                        )
                        (CONNECT_DATA = (SERVER = DEDICATED)
                                        (SID = dbname)
                        )
                )

If you don't wish to store your password in the configuration file, you can 
omit that line. If a password isn't present in the configuration file, you 
will be prompted for it at runtime.

You can choose whether or not to connect with the SYSDBA role. If the yaml 
file doesn't include the "sysdba" property, it will connect like a normal 
user.

As of version 2.1.0, the _cc methods have been added (query_to_df_cc, 
execute_cc, and insert_multiple_cc). These methods get passed a config file 
rather than a connection object and take care of opening and closing the 
connection for you.
