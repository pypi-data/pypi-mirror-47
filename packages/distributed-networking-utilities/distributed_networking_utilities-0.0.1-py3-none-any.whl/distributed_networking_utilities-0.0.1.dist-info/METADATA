## Distributed computing patterns and utilities.

DISCLAIMER: This project is under construction (and may always be).
While trying to construct a distributed and
highly scalable Face Recognition API I've been strugling with distributed
computing's perks and endup encapsulating some of the concepts I thought might be
usefull in other projects.
