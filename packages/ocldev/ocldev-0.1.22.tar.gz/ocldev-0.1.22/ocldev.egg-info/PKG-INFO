Description: # ocldev
        Development library for working with OCL metadata and APIs
        
        `ocldev` package is published to PyPi, which means you can easily install it with pip, eg:
        ```
        pip install ocldev
        ```
        
        Three main classes (and several supporting classes) are implemented currently:
        * OclFlexImporter - Used to import a list of JSON resources into OCL
        * OclImportResults - Optionally returned by the OclFlexImporter to process the results of the import
        * OclExport - Used to fetch an export from OCL
