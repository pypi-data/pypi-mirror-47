Aviation Weather parsing engine. METAR, TAF, and PIREP

## Install

The easiest way to get started is to download the library from pypi using pip

```bash
pip install avwx-engine
```

## Basic Usage

Reports use ICAO idents when specifying the desired station. Exceptions are thrown if a potentially invalid ident is given.

```python
>>> import avwx
>>>
>>> metar = avwx.Metar('KJFK')
>>> metar.station_info.name
'John F Kennedy International Airport'
>>> metar.update()
True
>>> metar.data.flight_rules
'IFR'
```

You can learn more by reading the [project documentation](https://avwx-engine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

**Note**: This library requires Python 3.6 or above

## Develop

Download and install the source code and its dependencies:

```bash
git clone github.com/flyinactor91/AVWX-Engine
cd AVWX-Engine
pip install -U .
```

Code checked into this repository is expected to be run through the `black` code formatter first.

```bash
# Install black
pip install black

# Format py package files
find avwx -iname "*.py" | xargs black
```

## Test

The easiest way to test the package is using `nox`. It will manage all tests, sessions, supported versions (when available), and cleanup. The tests will pick up the local version of `avwx`.

```bash
# Install
pip install nox

# Run all tests
nox
```

If you want to run the tests directly, the test suite was built while using the `pytest` library.

```bash
# Install
pip install pytest

# Run all unit tests
pytest
```

The end-to-end test files were generated using `util/build_tests.py` and placed into `tests/{report}`. Because Timestamp generation interprets the text based on the current date, Timestamp objects are nullified in the end-to-end tests.

## Docs

AVWX uses Sphinx to build its documentation. It's just another install:

```bash
pip install sphinx
```

To build the docs:

```bash
cd docs
make html
```
