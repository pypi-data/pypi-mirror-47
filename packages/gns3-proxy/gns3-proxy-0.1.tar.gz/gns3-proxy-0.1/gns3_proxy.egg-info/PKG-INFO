Description: gns3-proxy
        ==========
        
        Proof-of-concept for a Proxy Server for GNS3. The proxy is configured as a 
        regular remote server in the GNS3-GUI, as the GNS3-GUI client does not yet 
        support proxies [gns3-gui issue #2696](https://github.com/GNS3/gns3-gui/issues/2696). Basic idea 
        is to allow the use of central GNS3 server backends for classroom / lab setups,
        as used, e.g., in the Network Laboratory of Fulda University of Applied 
        Sciences. Students can connect to the proxy and requests will be authenticated,
        filtered and forwarded to appropriate backend servers. Proxy authentication
        also circumvents the current lack of multi-user support in GNS3. Without the
        proxy, due to the single user limitation (see "MULTIPLE USERS ENVIRONMENT"
        in [GNS3 Security](https://docs.gns3.com/1ON9JBXSeR7Nt2-Qum2o3ZX0GU86BZwlmNSUgvmqNWGY/index.html)),
        users will have to use the same admin credentials for GNS3 to access the 
        backend. Also, requests cannot be filtered and authorized (e.g., to deny
        deletion/creation of projects etc.). As GNS3 does not support proxies, several
        tweaks were necessary to the forked proxy.py project to allow transparent
        REST and WebSocket passthrough.

        Features
        --------
        
        Inherited from proxy.py:
        - Distributed as a single file module
        - No external dependency other than standard Python library
        - Support for `http`, `https` and `websockets` request proxy
        - Optimized for large file uploads and downloads
        - IPv4 and IPv6 support
        
        Changes/enhancements to proxy.py:
        - Redirect requests to backend servers (fixed proxing independent from request URL)
        - Definition of users (username and password used in GNS3-GUI) for authentication and authorization at the proxy, proxy replaces credentials for backend servers
        - Definition of allowed clients
        - Selection (mapping) of GNS3 backend server and possibility of load-balancing based on client IP and username (using regexp)
        - Filtering of denied requests to server backends (based on username, REST/HTTP method/URL path/headers/body (using regexp)
        - Configuration file to allow basic proxy configuration (as for proxy.py) as well as GNS3 backend server, users, clients, mappings and request filter
        - Support REST calls (GET requests with body etc.)
        - Fixes and tweaks to allow the connection to GNS3 backends, especially keeping connections alive and leaving HTTP headers to support direct passthrough of WebSocket connections
        - Basic access logging/status monitoring support
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Copy gns3_proxy.py and gns3_proxy_config.ini to a host that has Python >=3.4
        installed. Only change necessary in the GNS3 server, is to edit the regular
        gns3_server.conf (available in the appliance terminal and, e.g., used to
        change username password etc., see also
        [GNS3 server configuration file](https://docs.gns3.com/1f6uXq05vukccKdMCHhdki5MXFhV8vcwuGwiRvXMQvM0/index.html))
        and change the hostname from 0.0.0.0 to the IP address the server should
        listen on, e.g.:
        
        `host = 192.168.1.100`
        
        After that, run gns3_proxy.py and configure GNS3-GUI to use this host as a
        remote GNS3 server. By default, the proxy listens on 127.0.0.1 and TCP port 14080.
