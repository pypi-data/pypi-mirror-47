# About

The Python Ignite (PyIGN) package tool is used to interface with a Nation Instruments (NI) data acquisition (DAQ) console on a liquid rocket engine (LRE) test stand. PyIGN is fed input sensor data, gathered by the NI DAQ, then computes and controls the LRE systems states. The commands are output from PyIGN, back to the NI DAQ, which sets and controls valve and ignitor states.

# Installation

The PyIGN package relies on other libraries:

- numpy
- argparse


Install those before installing the PyIGN package. To install the PyIGN package:

- pip install pyign
