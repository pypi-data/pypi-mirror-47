        # Opedia
        Opedia is an open source database service to integrate, visualize, and analyze ocean datasets such as satellite data, in-situ observations, and model outputs. The project is supported by [Simons Foundation](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/).
        
        # System Requirements
        * [Anaconda Distribution Pyhton 3.7 -- 2.7](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
        * Make sure python is in system path.
        * Additional python modules:
        	- shapely
        	- fiona
        	- geopandas
        
        # Installation
        1.  **Set up database drivers (only required on macOS).**<br>
        	 install [homebrew](https://brew.sh/); a package manager for macOS.<br>
        	 ODBC driver provides the connection to the Opedia database.
        
        	```
        	$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"
        	$ brew install unixodbc
        	$ brew install freetds --with-unixodbc
        	```
        2. **Install [Python Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).**<br>
        Make sure python is added to the system path.  Anaconda distribution covers the majority of python modules used by Opedia. There are a few more required modules that need to be installed using the conda package manager; run the following commands to install them. Finally pip-install the opedia package itself.
        
        	```
        	$ conda install shapely
        	$ conda install fiona
        	$ conda install -c conda-forge geopandas
        
        	$ pip install opedia
        	```
