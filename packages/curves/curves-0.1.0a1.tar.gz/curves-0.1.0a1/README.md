### Installing
Whilst the curves project is on TestPyPI the two PyPI dependencies, pandas and pythonnet, will need to be installed manually as well as installing curves. Hence run the three commands below:
```
> pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ curves
> pip install pandas
> pip install pythonnet
```
