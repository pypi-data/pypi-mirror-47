Description: # issh
        
        [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/issh.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/py/issh)
        
        Improved SSH launcher that provides a browsable
        menu of SSH servers. Uses `~/.ssh/config`
        to generate menu.
        
        ## Install
        
        Install from pypi.org using:
        
        ```bash
        python -m pip install issh
        ```
        
        Install from source by running this from
        the root of the source code directory:
        
        ```bash
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        If uses Windows, also install `windows-curses` (included in setup.py).
        
        ```bash
        python -m pip install windows-curses
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Simply run `issh` from the command line to launch
        the menu.
        
        ```bash
        issh
        # or
        python -m issh
        ```
        
        If you have permission errors with the `~/.ssh/config` file,
        make sure the `.ssh/` directory has `700` permissions and
        the `config` file has `644` permissions. Also ensure
        the owner is correct.
