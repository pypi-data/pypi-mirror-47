Description: Email-assistant
        ===============
        
        Email-assistant reads email messages over IMAP and creates entries on
        a CalDAV server for events that it finds.
        
        It is designed to operate locally so that you remain in control of
        your data.
        
        It scans newly received emails to see if they match sources that it
        knows how to parse, and if so, extracts the schedule information from
        them and creates events.  It will avoid creating duplicate events,
        even if an email is seen multiple times.
        
        It currently understands emails from the following senders:
        
        * United Airlines
        * Marriott hotels (when booked directly)
        * Eventbrite
        
        It is simple to add support for more types of emails, and additions
        are welcome.
        
        Configuration
        -------------
        
        Create the file ``~/.config/email-assistant/config`` with the
        following contents:
        
        .. code-block::
        
           [mailbox example_mail]
           type = IMAP
           host = mail.example.com
           username = USERNAME
           password = PASSWORD
           folders = INBOX
        
           [calendar example_cal]
           type = caldav
           url = https://cloud.example.org/remote.php/dav/
           username = USERNAME
           password = PASSWORD
           calendar = Personal
        
           [pair]
           mailbox = example_mail
           calendar = example_cal
        
           [general]
           geocode = nominatim
        
        Change the ``username``, ``password``, ``host``, and ``url`` fields as
        appropriate, and optionally the ``folders`` field if you want to read
        from a folder other than your ``INBOX``.  You can also name the
        ``mailbox`` and ``calendar`` sections as you wish.  Their names are
        used in the ``pair`` section.  Multiple mailboxes, calendars, and
        pairs are supported.
        
        A ``pair`` section must have exactly one ``mailbox`` and ``calendar``
        entry.  It tells Email-assistant to read new messages from the
        specified mailbox and write events to the specified calendar.
        
        In some cases, emails do not contain the timezone information needed
        to make an ideal calendar event.  To add this data, Email-assistant
        can optionally use the OpenStreetMap Nominatim web service to
        determine the location of some events and add the appropriate
        timezone.  If you wish to enable this, include the ``general`` section
        above.  If you omit it, Email-assistant will simply schedule such
        events without a timezone.  This is used very rarely (currently, only
        for single-day events from Eventbrite).
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Once the configuration file is in place, run::
        
          email-assistant
        
        It will output information about actions it takes.  To get more debug
        information, run with the ``-v`` option.  To only output errors (for
        example, if you want to run it in a cron job) use the ``-q`` option.
