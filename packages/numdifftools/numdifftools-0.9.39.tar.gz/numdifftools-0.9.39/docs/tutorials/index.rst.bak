The pages in this section of the documentation are aimed at the newcomer to
numdifftools. They're designed to help you get started quickly, and show how
easy it is to work with numdifftools as a developer who wants to customise it and
get it working according to their own requirements.

These tutorials take you step-by-step through some key aspects of this work.
They're not intended to explain the :doc:`topics in depth </topics/index>`, or
provide :doc:`reference material </reference/index>`, but they will leave you
with a good idea of what it's possible to achieve in just a few steps, and how
to go about it.

Once you're familiar with the basics presented in these tutorials, you'll find
the more in-depth coverage of the same topics in the :doc:`How-to
</how_to/index>` section.

The tutorials follow a logical progression, starting from installation of numdifftools and the
creation of a brand new project, and build on each other, so it's recommended to work through them
in the order presented here.
