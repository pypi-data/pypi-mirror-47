Install guide
=============

Before you can use LibCdf, you'll need to get it installed. This guide will
guide you through a simple installation
that'll work while you walk through the introduction.


Install Python
==============

Being a Python library, LibCdf requires Python. Preferably you ned version 3.4 or
newer, but you get the latest version of Python at
https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section.

You can verify that Python is installed by typing ``python`` from the 'Anaconda Prompt' shell;
you should see something like:

.. code-block:: console


    Python 3.6.3 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Oct 15 2017, 03:27:45)
    [MSC v.1900 64 bit (AMD64)] on win32
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>>


You can start the 'Anaconda Prompt' shell from the 'Anaconda navigator'.
In the navigator click on 'Environments>base>Open terminal' as shown in the
:numref:`fig-anaconda-navigator` below:

.. _fig-anaconda-navigator:

.. figure:: ./AnacondaNavigator.png
    :scale: 100 %
    :align: center
    :alt: Anaconda Navigator
    :figclass: align-center

    *Anaconda Navigator Environments tab.*


Install 3'rd party libraries
============================
In addition LibCdf requires 3'rd party libraries: numpy 1.9 or newer, h5py 2.8.0 or newer,
scipy, lxml, defusedxml, inflection, pytest, pytest-cov, nvector,
pyface, traits and traitsui as well as pyqt.
Of these packages defusedxml, inflection, traits, and traitsui you may have to install
manually yourself. To do so start the 'Anaconda Prompt' shell and in that shell simply type:

.. code-block:: console

    $ conda install -c anaconda traits traitsui
    $ conda install -c conda-forge inflection defusedxml




Install LibCdf
==============

To install LibCdf, move to the folder where you have the 'libcdf-1.X.Y.tar.gz' file
and simply type in the 'Anaconda Prompt' shell:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install libcdf-1.X.Y.tar.gz


Verifying installation
======================
To verify that LibCdf can be seen by Python, type ``python`` from your shell.
Then at the Python prompt, try to import LibCdf:

.. parsed-literal::

    >>> import libcdf
    >>> print(libcdf.__version__)
    |release|


To test if the toolbox is working correctly paste the following in an interactive python prompt:

.. parsed-literal::

    libcdf.test('--doctest-module')


If the result show no errors, you now have installed a fully functional toolbox.
Congratulations!


That's it!
