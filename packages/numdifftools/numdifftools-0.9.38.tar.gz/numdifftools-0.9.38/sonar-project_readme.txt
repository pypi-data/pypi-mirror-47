Install SonarQube Scanner and be sure your can call sonar-scanner from the directory where you have your source code
Install SonarPython (see Installing a Plugin for more details)
(Optional) Install Pylint if you want to activate Pylint rules
Create a sonar-project.properties file at the root of your project (see a sample project on GitHub: https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-scanning-examples/tree/master/sonarqube-scanner)
Run sonar-scanner command from the project root dir
Follow the link provided at the end of the analysis to browse your project's quality in SonarQube UI.

import a Pylint Report
create your own Custom Rules

Get Started in Two Minutes
1. Download and unzip the SonarQube distribution (let's say in "C:\sonarqube" or "/etc/sonarqube")
2. Start the SonarQube server:
# On Windows, execute:
C:\sonarqube\bin\windows-x86-xx\StartSonar.bat
 
# On other operating system, execute:
/etc/sonarqube/bin/[OS]/sonar.sh console
3. Download and unzip the SonarQube Scanner (let's say in "C:\sonar-scanner" or "/etc/sonar-scanner")
4. Download and unzip some project samples (let's say in "C:\sonar-scanning-examples" or "/etc/sonar-scanning-examples")
5. Analyze a project:
# On Windows:
cd C:\sonar-scanning-examples\sonarqube-scanner
C:\sonar-scanner\bin\sonar-scanner.bat
 
# On other operating system:
cd /etc/sonar-scanning-examples/sonarqube-scanner
/etc/sonar-scanner/bin/sonar-scanner
6. Browse the results at http://localhost:9000 (default System administrator credentials are admin/admin)
