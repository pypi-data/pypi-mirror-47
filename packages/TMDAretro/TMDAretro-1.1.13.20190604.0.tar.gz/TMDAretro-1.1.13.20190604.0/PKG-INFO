Description: 
        TMDA is an open source software application designed to significantly
        reduce the amount of spam (Internet junk-mail) you receive.  TMDA
        strives to be more effective, yet less time-consuming than traditional
        spam filters.  TMDA can also be used as a general purpose local mail
        delivery agent to filter, sort, deliver and dispose of incoming mail.
        
        The technical countermeasures used by TMDA to thwart spam include:
        
        * whitelists: accept mail from known, trusted senders.
        
        * blacklists: refuse mail from undesired senders.
        
        * challenge/response: allows unknown senders which aren't on the
          whitelist or blacklist the chance to confirm that their message is
          legitimate (non-spam).
        
        * tagged addresses: special-purpose e-mail addresses such as
          time-dependent addresses, or addresses which only accept certain
          kinds of communication.  These increase the transparency of TMDA for
          unknown senders by allowing them to safely circumvent the
          challenge/response system.
