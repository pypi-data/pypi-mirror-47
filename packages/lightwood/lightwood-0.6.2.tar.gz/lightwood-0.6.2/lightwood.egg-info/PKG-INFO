        Think of Lightwood as [Keras](https://keras.io/)+[Ludwig](https://github.com/uber/ludwig) but for Pytorch, with two objectives:
        
        - Make it so simple that you can build models with just a few lines of code.
        - Make it so flexible that you can change and customize everything.
        
        
        ```python
        pip3 install lightwood
        ```
        We invite you to explore the [Lightwood's documentation site](https://mindsdb.github.io/lightwood/) to learn everything there is to know about the latest release.
