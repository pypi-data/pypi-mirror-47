Description: 
        Predictiveness curve is a method to display two graphs simultaneously. In both
        figures, the x-axis is risk percentile, the y-axis of one figure is the value
        of risk, and the y-axis of the other figure is true positive fractions. This
        makes it possible to visualize whether the model of risk fits in the medical
        field and which value of risk should be used as the basis for the model.
