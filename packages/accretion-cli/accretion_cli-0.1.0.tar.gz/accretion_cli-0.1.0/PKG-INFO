Description: *************
        Accretion CLI
        *************
        
        The Accretion CLI is the primary point for controlling Accretion resources.
        
        The Accretion CLI maintains configuration state in a "Deployment File".
        
        .. warning::
        
            Accretion is under active development and is not yet stable.
            The below reflects the target interface for the Accretion CLI.
            Not all commands will work yet.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        init
        ----
        
        Initialize the ``DEPLOYMENT_FILE`` for deployments to ``REGIONS``.
        
        This does NOT deploy to those regions.
        
        Run ``accretion update`` to update and fill all regions in a deployment file.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            accretion init DEPLOYMENT_FILE REGIONS...
        
        update
        ------
        
        Update deployments in all regions described in ``DEPLOYMENT_FILE``.
        
        This will also
        initialize any empty deployment regions
        and complete any partial deployments.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            accretion update all DEPLOYMENT_FILE
        
        
        add regions
        -----------
        
        Add more ``REGIONS`` to an existing deployment description in ``DEPLOYMENT_FILE``.
        
        This does NOT deploy to those regions.
        
        Run ``accretion update`` to update and fill all regions in a deployment file.
        
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            accretion add regions DEPLOYMENT_FILE REGIONS...
        
        
        destroy
        -------
        
        Destroy all resources for an Accretion deployment described in ``DEPLOYMENT_FILE``.
        
        .. warning::
        
            This will destroy ALL resources in ALL regions.
            Be sure that is what you want to do before running this.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            accretion destroy DEPLOYMENT_FILE
        
        
        request
        -------
        
        Request a new layer version build.
        
        .. important::
        
            These operations are currently completely asynchronous with no way of tracking a layer build through the CLI.
            I plan to add tooling around this later,
            but the exact form it will take is still TBD.

        raw
        ^^^
        
        Request a new layer in every region in ``DEPLOYMENT_FILE``.
        The Layer must be described in the Accretion format in ``REQUEST_FILE``.
        
        .. code:: json
        
            {
                "Name": "layer name",
                "Language": "Language to target",

                            "Details": "Requirement version or other identifying details"
                        }
                    ]
                },

                    "Type": "requirements.txt",
                    "Requirements": "Raw contents of requirements.txt file format"
                }
            }
        
        .. note::
        
            The only supported language at this time is ``python``.
        
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            accretion request raw DEPLOYMENT_FILE REQUEST_FILE
        
        requirements
        ^^^^^^^^^^^^
        
        Request a new layer named ``LAYER_NAME`` in every region in ``DEPLOYMENT_FILE``.
        The Layer requirements must be defined in the Python requirements.txt format in ``REQUIREMENTS_FILE``.
        
        .. code:: shell
        
            accretion request DEPLOYMENT_FILE REQUIREMENTS_FILE

        List all Accretion-managed Lambda Layers and their versions in the specified region.

            `This command has not yet been implemented <https://github.com/mattsb42/accretion/issues/4>`_.
        
        Check a "Request File" for correctness.

        Deployment File
        ===============
        
        .. warning::
        
            Deployment files MUST NOT be modified by anything other than Accretion tooling.
        
        An Accretion deployment file describes the stacks associated with a single Accretion deployment.
        
        It is a JSON file with the following structure:
        
        .. code:: json
        
            {
                "Deployments": {
                    "AWS_REGION": {
                        "Core": "STACK_NAME",
                        "ArtifactBuilder": "STACK_NAME",
                        "LayerBuilder": "STACK_NAME"
                    }
                }
            }
        
        
        .. _Request File:
        
        Request File
        ============
        
        An Accretion require file describes the Layer that is being requested.
        
        It is a JSON file with the following structure:
        
        .. code:: json
        
            {
                "Name": "layer name",
                "Language": "Language to target",
                "Requirements": {
                    "Type": "accretion",
                    "Requirements": [
                        {
                            "Name": "Requirement Name",
                            "Details": "Requirement version or identifying details"
                        }
                    ]

                    "Requirements": "Raw contents of requirements.txt file format"
                }
            }
