matrix_name = Matrix(dim=dimension,#Required(UNLESS 'listed' or 'directory' is given), int | list/tuple as [rows,cols]

                     listed=elements, #Optional, list of numbers | list of lists containing numbers | string. If no argument is passed matrix is filled depending on the 'fill' and 'ranged' 

                     directory=directory, #Optional, string. Path to the dataset. listed parameter shouldn't get any value if directory is given

                     fill=value, #Optional,Available distributions: 'uniform'|'triangular'|'gauss'; also accepts int|float|complex|str|list|range, fills the matrix with chosen distribution or number, None will force 'uniform' distribution. Doesn't affect the matrix if "listed" or "directory" is given

                     ranged=[*args] | dict;"""
                              ->To apply all the elements give a list | tuple
                              ->To apply every column individually give a dictionary as {"Column_name":[*args], ...}
                              ->Arguments should follow one of the following rules:
                                   1)If 'fill' is 'uniform', interval to pick numbers from as [minimum,maximum]; 
                                   2)If 'fill' is 'gauss', mean and standard deviation are picked from this attribute as [mean,standard_deviation];
                                   3)If 'fill' is 'triangular, range of the numbers and the mode as [minimum,maximum,mode]  """                     

                     header=hasHeader, #Optional, boolean. Default is 0. Wheter or not the dataset in the "directory" has a header row

                     features=columnNames #Optional, list of strings. If no argument given, columns get named "Col {}".format(colNumber) 

                     seed=randomSeed #Optional, int. Seed to generate the random numbers from, doesn't affect anything if numbers are provided.

                     dtype=dataType #Optional, 'integer'|'float'|'complex'|'dataframe' . Data type the matrix will hold, default is 'float'.

                     coldtypes=listOfTypes #Requires dtype=="dataframe" to work. Contains the data types each column will hold. If nothing is passed, types get declared by the first row.

                     implicit=False #Optional, boolean. If necessary parameters are given, this can be set to True to speed up the setup process. Don't change if you aren't sure what your matrix requires to work properly.
                     )

Some examples:
--------------
##### Create matrices filled with random numbers or given values
```python 
#Creates a 4x4 matrix filled with random float numbers
A = Matrix(4) 

#Creates a 3x5 matrix with elements uniformly distributed in the range from 10 to 25
B = Matrix([3,5],ranged=[10,25])

```
----------------------------------------
##### Generate randomly filled matrices using special distributions
```python
#Create a 10000x3 integer numbers matrix using a triangular distribution that is symmetrical by the modes 50,25 and 20 for each column limited by [0,100], [-50,50] and [10,20] in order with the seed 32141. Column names are selected from ranged.keys()
randomData1 = Matrix((10000,3),
                     fill='triangular',
                     ranged={"Feature_1":(0,100,50),"Feature_2":(-50,50,25),"Feature_3":(10,20,20)},
                     seed=32141,
                     dtype="integer")

#Create a 10000x4 float numbers matrix using uniform distribution where columns' ranges are in order [10,100], [200,500], [200,1000] and [0,10] with the seed 39598 for each column. Column names are selected from ranged.keys()
randomData2 = Matrix([10000,4],
                     ranged={"height":[10,100],"weight":[200,500],"cost":[200,1000],"quality":[0,10]},
                     seed=39598)

#Create a 10000x4 matrix float numbers using normal(gauss) distribution where [0,25], [100,200], [1000,10000] and [1,100] are columns' means and standard deviations and the seed is 4472142 for each column. Column names are selected from ranged.keys()
randomData3 = Matrix([10000,4],

                     ranged={"feature1":[0,25],"feature2":[100,200],"feature3":[1000,10000],"feature4":[1,100]},
                     seed=4472142)

```
----------------------------------------
##### Create special matrices
```python 
from MatricesM.constructors.matrices import Identity

#3x3 identity matrix
id3 = Matrix(listed=Identity(3))

from MatricesM.constructors.matrices import Symmetrical

#A 8x8 symmetrical matrix filled with numbers in range from 0 to 1 with uniform distribution 
sym1 = Matrix(listed=Symmetrical(8))

``` 
----------------------------------------
##### Give list of numbers to create matrices
```python 
#Creates a matrix with the given list of numbers
filled_rows = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]

C = Matrix(listed=filled_rows) 

#Create a dataframe from a list
data = [["James",180.4,85],
        ["Tom",172,73],
        ["Sophia",168.25,65]]

df = Matrix(listed=data,
            dtype="dataframe",
            features=["Name","Height","Weight"],
            decimal=1)

#coldtypes parameter may be required in cases where the data given doesn't represent the desired data types
``` 
----------------------------------------
##### Give a string filled with data and use the numbers in it to create a matrix
```python 
#Creates a 3x3 matrix from the given string
C1 = Matrix(3,"1 0 -1 4 5 5 1 2 2") 

#Creates a 2x4 matrix from the given string
C2 = Matrix([2,4],"5 -2 -3 2 1 0 0 4")

#Create a matrix from the given string, dimension is *required* as [dataAmount,features]. Only numbers are picked up
data="""1,K,60,69900,6325
2,K,30,79000,5200
3,E,52,85500,7825
4,E,57,17100,8375
5,E,55,5500,5450
6,E,68,27200,8550
7,E,41,20500,4500
8,E,20,69000,5050
9,K,33,13200,8325
10,E,37,31800,5975"""

#As an integer matrix
intMat = Matrix(dim=[10,4],
                listed=data,
                features=["id","age","num1","num2"],
                dtype="integer") 

#Or as a dataframe
df = Matrix(dim=[10,4],
            listed=data,
            features=["id","age","num1","num2"],
            dtype="dataframe",
            coldtypes=[int]*4)

```
----------------------------------------
##### Read data from files (Only tested on CSV and TXT files)
###### If there is a header, set header to any boolean value == True . Float numbers considered to be using dot(.) to separate decimal places and cammas(,) are used to separate columns. Will be updated in the future for more options
```python 
data_directory = r"Example\Directory\DATAFILE"

data_matrix = Matrix(directory=data_directory,header=1,dtype="dataframe",coldtypes=[str,float,...]) #Create a dataframe matrix from a csv file

#If you're having issues with setting the dimension, try explicitly providing it as dim=[data_amount,feature_amount]
#More options for reading the file will be added in the future

#Example dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009
winedata = Matrix(directory="...\Data\winequality-red.csv",header=1,dtype="dataframe",coldtypes=[float]*12)
```
----------------------------------------
##### Get specific parts of the matrix
```python
#All rows' second to forth columns as a matrix
C[:,1:4] == C.t[1:4,:].t

#Nineth column of every even numbered row as a matrix
C[::2,8] == C[::2,8:9] == C.col(9)[::2] == C["Col 9"][::2] == C.select(("Col 9"))[::2]

#Forth to seventh rows as a matrix
C[3:7] 

#Fifth row's eighth element (returns the value as it is, not a new matrix)
C[4,7] == C.matrix[4][7]

#Use column names
C["Col 3","Col 1","Col 2"] == C.select(("Col 3","Col 1","Col 2"))
```
----------------------------------------
##### Filter out depending on what you need
```python 
#Using example dataset, get the rows where the "quality" feature is higher or equal to 6 and pH in range (3,3.3)
#All statements should be properly closed with parentheses
wineOverSix = winedata.where("(quality>6) and ((pH<3.3) and (pH>3))")
#Alternative way (2x faster)
wineOverSix = winedata[(winedata["quality"]>6) & ((winedata["pH"]<3.3) & (winedata["pH"]>3))]

#Select the columns of pH and quality and assign them to another matrix
filtered = winedata.select(("pH","quality"))
#Alternative way (2x faster)
filtered = winedata["pH","quality"] 


#Set index column to reverse further actions
winedata.indexSet()

#Sort by given column and shuffle the data
winedata.sortBy("quality") #Data is sorted in increasing order, use reverse=True for decreasing order

#Shuffle the rows
winedata.shuffle()

#Get 20 samples from the data under desired conditions
winedata.sample(20,"(quality>5) and ((alcohol<11) or (density>0.95))")
#Alternative way (1.5x faster)
winedata[(winedata["quality"]>5) & ((winedata["alcohol"]<11) | (winedata["density"]>0.95))].sample(20)

#Return all the rows and select 'alcohol' and 'quality' columns where quality is higher than 6
winedata[winedata["quality"]>6,("alcohol", "quality")]

```
----------------------------------------
##### Apply arithmetic operations to individual rows and columns.
```python
#Create a 1000x2 dataframe filled using normal distribution with given arguments
marketData = Matrix((1000,2),fill="gauss",ranged={"Price":(250,60),"Discount":(8,2)},dtype="dataframe")

#Change invalid values in "Discount" column where it's less than 0 to 0
marketData[marketData["Discount"]<0,"Discount"] = 0

#Explore the data
marketData.describe

#Multiply 'Price' with 0.9 and subtract 5 also add 10 to 'Discount' under the conditions: Price>100 and Discount<5
marketData.apply( ("*0.9 -5","+10"), ("Price","Discount"), "(Price>100) and (Discount<5)" )
```
----------------------------------------
##### Replace values in the matrix
```python
#Replace all 0's with 1's
data.replace(old=0,new=1)

#Replace all "Pending" values to "Done" in "Order1" and "Order2" columns
data.replace(old="Pending", #(data["Order1"]=="Pending") & (data["Order2"]=="Pending") can also be used
             new="Done",
             column=("Order1","Order2")
             )

#Replace all '' values in the column "Length" with the mean of the "Length" column
data.replace=(old='', #data["Length"]=="" can also be used
              new=data.mean("Length",asDict=False),
              column="Length"
              )

#Replace all "FF" values in "Grade" column with "AA" in the column "Grade" where "Year" is less than 2019
data.replace(old="FF", #data["Grade"]=="FF" can also be used
             new="AA",
             column="Grade",
             condition=data["Year"]<=2019
             )

#Replace all numbers below 0 in with 0's in column named "F5" where "Score1" is less than "Score2"
data.replace(old=data["F5"]<0,
             new=0,
             column="F5",
             condition=data["Score1"]<data["Score2"]
             )

#Change value of 'Feature5' to 0 in the rows where the 'Feature1' is lower than 0
data[data["Feature1"]<0,"Feature5"] = 0

#Create a matrix with a square filled with 0's in the middle, 5's outside
s = Matrix(10,fill=5,dtype="integer")
s[3:7,3:7] = 0
#Matrices can also be used to do the same
s[3:7,3:7] = Matrix(4,fill=0)
```
----------------------------------------
##### Concatenate a matrix to your matrix.
```python
#Concatenate a new column named 'discounted' containing the product of the 'Price' and 'Discount' columns
newcol = marketData["Price"] - marketData["Price"]*(marketData["Discount"]/100)
newcol.features = ["discounted"]
marketData.concat(newcol,"col")

```

C.z(col,population) #Returns the z-scores of the desired  column, call without arguments to get the all z-scores as a matrix. Give population parameter 1 if calculation is not for samples, 0 otherwise.

C.corr(column_1,column_2,population) #Returns linear correlation of 2 columns chosen from the matrix. If no argument given, returns the correlation matrix. Give population parameter 1 if calculation is not for samples, 0 otherwise

C.normalize(column,inplace) #Normalize the data in the desired column, None to normalize all columns. Give inplace parameter "True" boolean value to make normalization in-place, "False" to return a new matrix with normalized data

C.stdize(column,inplace) #Standardize the data in the desired column, None to standardize all columns. Give inplace parameter "True" boolean value to make standardization in-place, "False" to return a new matrix with standardized data

C.features #Returns the column names if given, can also be used to set column names

C.coldtypes #Returns what type of data each column carries, can be used to set the values.

C.setFeatures() #Can be used to fix column naming issues, sets the column names to defaults

C.setcoldtypes(declare) #Can be used to fix column type related issues, sets the column types to what first row carries. If declare is True, individual dtypes are applied to every element in the matrix

----------------------------------------
##### Printing options
```python
#All the values + column names if it's a dataframe

myMatrix.grid 

#Dimensions + wheter its square or not + the string printed in 'grid' property

myMatrix.p #Same as print(myMatrix)

#Similar to 'grid' but rows and columns are limited by myMatrix.ROW_LIMIT and myMatrix.COL_LIMIT

myMatrix

#Issues about dtypes not matching and/or missing data can be solved by using 'replace' method
```

##### All calculations below returns a matrix filled with 1's where the condition is True, otherwise 0
```python 
   A**2 == A*A

   A*2 == A+A

   A.t.t == A

   A.adj.matrix[2][0] == A.minor(1,3)

   A == A.sym + A.anti
   #bool object can be called to get a boolean value of the matrix, if all elements are 1's then it will return True and False in any other case.
   bool(Matrix(10,fill=1)) == True

   #round call is currently required for the next examples due to <~%1e-5 error rate on some calculations
   round(A @ Matrix(listed=Identity(A.dim[0])),4) == round(A, 4) #A assumed to be a square matrix

   round(A.lowtri @ A.uptri, 4) == round(A, 4)

   round(A.inv.inv,4) == round(A, 4)

   round(A.Q @ A.R, 4) == round(A, 4)

   round(A @ A.inv)== Matrix(listed=Identity(A.dim[0]))
```
