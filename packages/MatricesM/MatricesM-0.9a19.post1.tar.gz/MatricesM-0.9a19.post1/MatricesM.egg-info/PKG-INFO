        ### Install using pip:
           
           <code>pip install MatricesM</code>
           
        ### Import by using:
           ```python 
           import MatricesM.matrix as mm #Use by calling : mm.Matrix(arguments)
           ```
           #### OR
           ```python 
           from MatricesM.matrix import * #Use matrices directly : Matrix(arguments)
           ```
        ### Import and print example matrices:
           ```python 
           from MatricesM.exampleMatrices import *
           ```
        
        ### Basic syntax:
        ```python 
        
        matrix_name = Matrix(dim=dimension,#Required(UNLESS 'listed' or 'directory' is given), int | list/tuple as [rows,cols]
        
                             listed=elements, #Optional, list of numbers | list of lists containing numbers | string. If no argument is passed matrix is filled depending on the 'fill' and 'ranged' 
        
                             directory=directory, #Optional, string. Path to the dataset. listed parameter shouldn't get any value if directory is given
        
                             fill=value, #Optional,Available distributions: uniform|triangular|gauss; also accepts int|float|complex|str|list|range, fills the matrix with chosen distribution or number, None will force uniform distribution. Doesn't affect the matrix if "listed" or "directory" is given
        
                             ranged=[*args] | dict;"""
                                      ->To apply all the elements give a list | tuple
                                      ->To apply every column individually give a dictionary as {"Column_name":[*args], ...}
                                      ->Arguments should follow one of the following rules:
                                           1)If 'fill' is uniform, interval to pick numbers from as [minimum,maximum]; 
                                           2)If 'fill' is gauss, mean and standard deviation are picked from this attribute as [mean,standard_deviation];
                                           3)If 'fill' is triangular, range of the numbers and the mode as [minimum,maximum,mode]  """                     
        
                             header=hasHeader, #Optional, boolean. Default is 0. Wheter or not the dataset in the "directory" has a header row
        
                             features=columnNames #Optional, list of strings. If no argument given, columns get named "Col {}".format(colNumber) 
                             
                             seed=randomSeed #Optional, int. Seed to generate the random numbers from, doesn't affect anything if numbers are provided.
                               
                             dtype=dataType #Optional, 'integer'|'float'|'complex'|'dataframe' . Data type the matrix will hold, default is 'float'.
                             
                             coldtypes=listOfTypes #Requires dtype=="dataframe" to work. Contains the data types each column will hold. If nothing is passed, types get declared by the first row.
                             
                             implicit=False #Optional, boolean. If necessary parameters are given, this can be set to True to speed up the setup process. Don't change if you aren't sure what your matrix requires to work properly.
                             )

        -------------- 
        Some examples:
        --------------
        ##### Create matrices filled with random numbers or given values
        ```python 
        #Creates a 4x4 matrix filled with random float numbers
        A = Matrix(4) 
        
        #Creates a 3x5 matrix with elements uniformly distributed in the range from 10 to 25
        B = Matrix([3,5],ranged=[10,25]) 
        
        #Create a 6x6 square matrix filled with random integer numbers in the default range: [0,1]
        E = Matrix(6,dtype="integer") 
        
        #Create a 200x5 matrix using Gauss distribution with mean=50 and standard deviation=10
        F = Matrix([200,5],fill=gauss,ranged=[50,10]) 
        
        #Create a 10x10 matrix filled with 1's
        G = Matrix(10,fill=1)
        
        #Create a 200x4 matrix filled with integer numbers using triangular distribution where the range is [0,20] and mode is around if not 18
        H = Matrix((200,4),fill=triangular,ranged=[0,20,18],dtype="integer") 
        
        #Create a 9x9 matrix filled with complex numbers using gauss distribution for both real and imaginary parts with mean=5 and sdev=2
        C1 = Matrix(9,fill=gauss,ranged=[5,2],dtype="complex")
        
        #Create a 10x1 matrix filled with the given string
        S = Matrix((10,1),fill="hello",dtype="dataframe")
        ```
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Generate randomly filled matrices using special distributions
        ```python
        #Create a 10000x3 integer numbers matrix using a triangular distribution that is symmetrical by the modes 50,25 and 20 for each column limited by [0,100], [-50,50] and [10,20] in order with the seed 32141. Column names are selected from ranged.keys()
        randomData1 = Matrix((10000,3),
                             fill=triangular,
                             ranged={"Feature_1":(0,100,50),"Feature_2":(-50,50,25),"Feature_3":(10,20,20)},
                             seed=32141,
                             dtype="integer")
        
        #Create a 10000x4 float numbers matrix using uniform distribution where columns' ranges are in order [10,100], [200,500], [200,1000] and [0,10] with the seed 39598 for each column. Column names are selected from ranged.keys()
        randomData2 = Matrix([10000,4],
                             ranged={"height":[10,100],"weight":[200,500],"cost":[200,1000],"quality":[0,10]},
                             seed=39598)
        
        #Create a 10000x4 matrix float numbers using normal(gauss) distribution where [0,25], [100,200], [1000,10000] and [1,100] are columns' means and standard deviations and the seed is 4472142 for each column. Column names are selected from ranged.keys()
        randomData3 = Matrix([10000,4],
                             fill=gauss,
                             ranged={"feature1":[0,25],"feature2":[100,200],"feature3":[1000,10000],"feature4":[1,100]},
                             seed=4472142)
        
        ```
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Create special matrices
        ```python 
        from MatricesM.constructors.matrices import Identity
        
        #3x3 identity matrix
        id3 = Matrix(listed=Identity(3))
        
        from MatricesM.constructors.matrices import Symmetrical
        
        #A 8x8 symmetrical matrix filled with numbers in range from 0 to 1 with uniform distribution 
        sym1 = Matrix(listed=Symmetrical(8))
        
        ``` 
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Give list of numbers to create matrices
        ```python 
        #Creates a matrix with the given list of numbers
        filled_rows = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
        
        C = Matrix(listed=filled_rows) 
        
        #Create a dataframe from a list
        data = [["James",180.4,85],
                ["Tom",172,73],
                ["Sophia",168.25,65]]
                
        df = Matrix(listed=data,
                    dtype="dataframe",
                    features=["Name","Height","Weight"],
                    decimal=1)
        
        #coldtypes parameter may be required in cases where the data given doesn't represent the desired data types
        ``` 
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Give a string filled with data and use the numbers in it to create a matrix
        ```python 
        #Creates a 3x3 matrix from the given string
        C1 = Matrix(3,"1 0 -1 4 5 5 1 2 2") 
        
        #Creates a 2x4 matrix from the given string
        C2 = Matrix([2,4],"5 -2 -3 2 1 0 0 4")
        
        #Create a matrix from the given string, dimension is *required* as [dataAmount,features]. Only numbers are picked up
        data="""1,K,60,69900,6325
        2,K,30,79000,5200
        3,E,52,85500,7825
        4,E,57,17100,8375
        5,E,55,5500,5450
        6,E,68,27200,8550
        7,E,41,20500,4500
        8,E,20,69000,5050
        9,K,33,13200,8325
        10,E,37,31800,5975"""
        
        #As an integer matrix
        intMat = Matrix(dim=[10,4],
                        listed=data,
                        features=["id","age","num1","num2"],
                        dtype="integer") 
        
        #Or as a dataframe
        df = Matrix(dim=[10,4],
                    listed=data,
                    features=["id","age","num1","num2"],
                    dtype="dataframe",
                    coldtypes=[int]*4)
        
        ```
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Read data from files (Only tested on CSV and TXT files)
        ###### If there is a header, set header to any boolean value == True . Float numbers considered to be using dot(.) to separate decimal places and cammas(,) are used to separate columns. Will be updated in the future for more options
        ```python 
        data_directory = r"Example\Directory\DATAFILE"
        
        data_matrix = Matrix(directory=data_directory,header=1,dtype="dataframe",coldtypes=[str,float,...]) #Create a dataframe matrix from a csv file
        
        #If you're having issues with setting the dimension, try explicitly providing it as dim=[data_amount,feature_amount]
        #More options for reading the file will be added in the future
        
        #Example dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009
        winedata = Matrix(directory="...\Data\winequality-red.csv",header=1,dtype="dataframe",coldtypes=[float]*12)
        ```
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Get specific parts of the matrix
        ```python
        #All rows' second to forth columns as a matrix
        C[:,1:4] == C.t[1:4,:].t
        
        #Nineth column of every even numbered row as a matrix
        C[::2,8] == C[::2,8:9] == C.col(9)[::2] == C["Col 9"][::2] == C.select(("Col 9"))[::2]
        
        #Forth to seventh rows as a matrix
        C[3:7] 
        
        #Fifth row's eighth element (returns the value as it is, not a new matrix)
        C[4,7] == C.matrix[4][7]
        
        #Use column names
        C["Col 3","Col 1","Col 2"] == C.select(("Col 3","Col 1","Col 2"))
        ```
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Filter out depending on what you need
        ```python 
        #Using example dataset, get the rows where the "quality" feature is higher or equal to 6 and pH in range (3,3.3)
        #All statements should be properly closed with parentheses
        wineOverSix = winedata.where("(quality>6) and ((pH<3.3) and (pH>3))")
        #Alternative way (2x faster)
        wineOverSix = winedata[(winedata["quality"]>6) & ((winedata["pH"]<3.3) & (winedata["pH"]>3))]
        
        #Select the columns of pH and quality and assign them to another matrix
        filtered = winedata.select(("pH","quality"))
        #Alternative way (2x faster)
        filtered = winedata["pH","quality"] 
        
        
        #Set index column to reverse further actions
        winedata.indexSet()
        
        #Sort by given column and shuffle the data
        winedata.sortBy("quality") #Data is sorted in increasing order, use reverse=True for decreasing order
        
        #Shuffle the rows
        winedata.shuffle()
        
        #Get 20 samples from the data under desired conditions
        winedata.sample(20,"(quality>5) and ((alcohol<11) or (density>0.95))")
        #Alternative way (1.5x faster)
        winedata[(winedata["quality"]>5) & ((winedata["alcohol"]<11) | (winedata["density"]>0.95))].sample(20)
        
        #Return all the rows and select 'alcohol' and 'quality' columns where quality is higher than 6
        winedata[winedata["quality"]>6,("alcohol", "quality")]
        
        ```
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Apply arithmetic operations to individual rows and columns.
        ```python
        #Create a 1000x2 dataframe filled using normal distribution with given arguments
        marketData = Matrix((1000,2),fill=gauss,ranged={"Price":(250,60),"Discount":(8,2)},dtype="dataframe")
        
        #Change invalid values in "Discount" column where it's less than 0 to 0
        marketData[marketData["Discount"]<0,"Discount"] = 0
        
        #Explore the data
        marketData.describe
        
        #Multiply 'Price' with 0.9 and subtract 5 also add 10 to 'Discount' under the conditions: Price>100 and Discount<5
        marketData.apply( ("*0.9 -5","+10"), ("Price","Discount"), "(Price>100) and (Discount<5)" )
        ```
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Replace values in the matrix
        ```python
        #Replace all 0's with 1's
        data.replace(old=0,new=1)
        
        #Replace all "Pending" values to "Done" in "Order1" and "Order2" columns
        data.replace(old="Pending", #(data["Order1"]=="Pending") & (data["Order2"]=="Pending") can also be used
                     new="Done",
                     column=("Order1","Order2")
                     )
        
        #Replace all '' values in the column "Length" with the mean of the "Length" column
        data.replace=(old='', #data["Length"]=="" can also be used
                      new=data.mean("Length",asDict=False),
                      column="Length"
                      )
        
        #Replace all "FF" values in "Grade" column with "AA" in the column "Grade" where "Year" is less than 2019
        data.replace(old="FF", #data["Grade"]=="FF" can also be used
                     new="AA",
                     column="Grade",
                     condition=data["Year"]<=2019
                     )
        
        #Replace all numbers below 0 in with 0's in column named "F5" where "Score1" is less than "Score2"
        data.replace(old=data["F5"]<0,
                     new=0,
                     column="F5",
                     condition=data["Score1"]<data["Score2"]
                     )
                     
        #Change value of 'Feature5' to 0 in the rows where the 'Feature1' is lower than 0
        data[data["Feature1"]<0,"Feature5"] = 0
        
        #Create a matrix with a square filled with 0's in the middle, 5's outside
        s = Matrix(10,fill=5,dtype="integer")
        s[3:7,3:7] = 0
        #Matrices can also be used to do the same
        s[3:7,3:7] = Matrix(4,fill=0)
        ```
        ----------------------------------------
        ##### Concatenate a matrix to your matrix.
        ```python
        #Concatenate a new column named 'discounted' containing the product of the 'Price' and 'Discount' columns
        newcol = marketData["Price"] - marketData["Price"]*(marketData["Discount"]/100)
        newcol.features = ["discounted"]
        marketData.concat(newcol,"col")
        
        ```
        ----------------------------------------
        #### Use your matrix's methods and properties
        ##### Basics
        ```python 
        C.grid #Prints ALL of the matrix's elements as a grid, if dtype is 'dataframe', column names also get printed
        
        C.p #Prints the dimensions, wheter or not the matrix is square and the grid. If dtype is 'dataframe', column names are also printed
