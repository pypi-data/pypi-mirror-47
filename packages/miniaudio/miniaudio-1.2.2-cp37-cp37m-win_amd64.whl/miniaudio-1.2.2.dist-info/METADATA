# Python miniaudio

This module provides:

- the [miniaudio](https://github.com/dr-soft/miniaudio/) cross platform sound playback and conversion library
- its decoders for wav, flac, vorbis and mp3
- python bindings via cffi for much of the functions offered in those libraries:
  - getting audio file properties (such as duration, number of channels, sample rate) 
  - reading and decoding audio files
  - streaming audio files
  - playback  (via efficient asynchronous pull-API)
  - streaming and playback are done with generator functions  


*Requires Python 3.5 or newer.  Also works on pypy3 (because it uses cffi).* 

Currently, it is only distributed in source form so you need a C compiler to build and install this.
For Linux and Mac this shouldn't be a problem. For Windows users it may be though:
you have to make sure that the required tools (Visual Studio or 
the C++ build tools) are installed that allow you to compile Python extension modules.

## Todo

- the various format conversion functions aren't properly exposed yet.
- only playback for now, the recording capabilities of miniaudio aren't exposed yet

    flac_stream_file(filename: str, frames_to_read: int = 1024) -> Generator[array.array, NoneType, NoneType]
        Streams the flac audio file as interleaved 16 bit signed integer sample arrays segments.

    decode(data: bytes, ma_output_format: int = 2, nchannels: int = 2, sample_rate: int = 44100) -> miniaudio.DecodedSoundFile
        Convenience function to decode any supported audio file in memory to raw PCM samples in your chosen format.

    decode_file(filename: str, ma_output_format: int = 2, nchannels: int = 2, sample_rate: int = 44100) -> miniaudio.DecodedSoundFile
        Convenience function to decode any supported audio file to raw PCM samples in your chosen format.

        Convenience generator function to decode and stream any supported audio file
        as chunks of raw PCM samples in the chosen format.
        If you send() a number into the generator rather than just using next() on it,
        you'll get that given number of frames, instead of the default configured amount.
        This is particularly useful to plug this stream into an audio device callback that
        wants a variable number of frames per call.

        Convenience generator function to decode and stream any supported audio file in memory
        as chunks of raw PCM samples in the chosen format.
        If you send() a number into the generator rather than just using next() on it,
        you'll get that given number of frames, instead of the default configured amount.
