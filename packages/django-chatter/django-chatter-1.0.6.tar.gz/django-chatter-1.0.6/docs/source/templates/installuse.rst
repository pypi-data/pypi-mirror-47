Installation and Use
====================

Installing Chatter requires several simple steps. While previous exposure to
`Django Channels <channels.readthedocs.io>`_ would help you, it's not required.

--------------
Pre-requisites
--------------

Chatter only supports Python >= 3.5 and Django >= 2.0.9 as far as the developers
are concerned. So, to be able to integrate Chatter, you're going to need them
installed.

Added to that, Chatter uses Redis as its message broker. This means that all the
chat messages are communicated between all connected users through the Redis
datastore. Given that, you have to have Redis installed on your system. Details on
installing Redis can be found on their `Downloads <https://redis.io/download>`_
page.

------------
Installation
------------

* Chatter is on `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/django-chatter/>`_ now!
  To install it, run

  .. code-block:: python

    pip install django-chatter

  This should install all the required dependencies for Chatter.

* Once you're done with that, add it to your :code:`settings.INSTALLED_APPS`:

  .. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
      ...
      'django_chatter',
      ...
      ]

* Since we use Redis as our message broker, you need to enable channel layers
  for Chatter's ChatConsumer
  (see `Channels' Consumers
  <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/consumers.html>`_
  for more details). To enable that, you need to add the following lines to
  your project's :code:`settings.py` file:

  .. code-block:: python

    CHANNEL_LAYERS = {
      'default': {
          'BACKEND': 'channels_redis.core.RedisChannelLayer',
          'CONFIG': {
            'hosts': [('127.0.0.1', 6379)],
          },
      },
    }


* If you haven't already, create a file named :code:`routing.py` in your
  project's configuration folder.
  This is because Django Channels uses a specification called
  `ASGI <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/asgi.html>`_
  for its websocket protocol. To enable Channels on your app, you have to add
  a file that routes all websocket requests to a Channels app
  (in this case, Chatter).
  This should be the same as the folder where your :code:`settings.py`
  file is located.

  In :code:`routing.py`, add the following lines:

  .. code-block:: python

    from channels.auth import AuthMiddlewareStack
    from channels.routing import ProtocolTypeRouter, URLRouter
    import django_chatter.routing

    application = ProtocolTypeRouter({
      'websocket': AuthMiddlewareStack(
        URLRouter(
        django_chatter.routing.websocket_urlpatterns # send request to chatter's urls
        )
      )
    })

  This routes all websocket requests to Chatter, with the logged in :code:`User`
  object. If you are using different
  `django-channels <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_
  applications other than Chatter, you may already have this file, and can add
  the appropriate URL for chatter to handle.
  More details can be found on Django Channels'
  `Routing <https://channels.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/routing.html>`_ page.

  If you know how the middleware wrapping in
  `Channels <https://github.com/django/channels/blob/master/channels/auth.py>`_
  works, then feel free to replace :code:`AuthMiddlewareStack` with what you use
  as your auth middleware for User object processing (if you're curious to know
  about this, get in touch! We'd be happy to talk to you about it).

* Now that you're done setting up :code:`routing.py`, add the following line in
  your :code:`settings.py` file to enable routing websocket requests to the
  appropriate app:

  .. code-block:: python

    ASGI_APPLICATION = 'mysite.routing.application'

* Link :code:`django_chatter.urls` to the URL you want in your
  URLConf (:code:`<project>/urls.py`).

  Example:

  .. code-block:: python

    from django.urls import path, include

    ...
    urlpatterns = [
      ...,
      path('chat/', include('django_chatter.urls')),
      ...
    ]

* Run migrations:

  .. code-block:: bash

    $ python manage.py makeimigrations django_chatter
    $ python manage.py migrate

* Start your app's development server and go to your :code:`'/chat/'` URL,
  and you will see Chatter's homepage.

-----------
Usage Notes
-----------

* Chatter, as of right now, provides a very minimal interface for users to chat
  with other users.For starters, while group chatting is supported on the model
  layer, the corresponding templates and front-end logic have not yet been setup.

* If you're using chatter as a package in your own app, you have to make sure
  that you handle user authentication in your app. Chatter, by default, provides
  views that require user authentication. If you're developing Chatter on the other
  hand, the usage will vary a bit. The notes for that can be found in the
  :doc:`Get Involved <develop>` section.
