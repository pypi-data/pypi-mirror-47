\section{Introduction}

Hybrid Quantum Classical (HQC) computation
as being pursued by Rigetti Inc. involves
minimizing a ``quantum cost function", i.e.,
the mean value of a Hermitian operator,
wherein that mean value is calculated empirically from
the data yielded by a physical quantum computer.

There are many methods available for minimizing
a cost function on a classical computer.
Which minimizing method performs
best for a particular case depends on the nature of
the cost function and of the
computing resources at the user's disposal.
Some methods, like, for instance,
the  Powell method (available on
{\tt scipy.optimize.minimize}),
do not require
calculating
the gradient of the cost function.
Others, the ``gradient based methods", do.
One method that is particularly well
suited to AI problems when
distributed computing (GPU, TPU)
resources are available, is
gradient descent
used in conjunction with
a method of calculating gradients
called back-propagation (BP).
This begs the question,
can we find a good
method like BP for calculating
the gradients of a quantum cost function,
and then use gradient descent to
minimize the cost function?
The grand goal is to
give an exact analytical
formula for the gradients of a quantum cost function,
and to
express that formula as a sum of parts that
can each be readily evaluated empirically on a qc.

Several teams from the Univ. of Tokyo
Refs.\cite{japan}\cite{japan2},
Xanadu Inc. Ref.\cite{xanadu}, and QCWare Inc.
Ref.\cite{qcware}
have already
implemented their own algorithms for
accomplishing this grand goal.
Refs. \cite{japan} and \cite{xanadu}
use a formula that allows them to split
the calculation of the gradient
of a single uncontrolled rotation
along either the X, Y or Z axes into two
quantum circuits. Refs.\cite{japan2}
and \cite{qcware} use a tomographic approach.

The method proposed in this paper to tackle this grand goal
is not tomographic like the methods of Refs.\cite{japan2}
and \cite{qcware}.
Our method is more akin to the approach of
Refs. \cite{japan} and \cite{xanadu},
except that we use an ancilla qubit (they don't),
and we handle the case of gates with multiple
controls (they
only consider derivatives of gates with no controls).
Furthermore, we apply our method to a novel
quantum circuit, a quantum neural net
inspired by Quantum Bayesian Networks.
Last but not least, we point out
the huge benefits of ``qc threading" for
our method.
The benefits are particularly
high for NISQ (Noisy Intermediate Scale
Quantum) devices such as those available on the Rigetti Cloud.

This paper describing our method is being released
concurrently with a full implementation,
open source, in Python, of our method.
The implementation is part of
 the Qubiter repo at GitHub.


\section{Derivative of Uncontrolled U(2) gate}\label{sect-deriv}

In this section,
we  will show how to express
the derivative of
a 2-dim U(2) matrix with respect
to one of its 4 parameters,
as a linear combination of three U(2) matrices.
Luckily,
the parameters of most standard quantum gates
always appear inside
a 2-dim U(2) matrix with zero, one, or more controls
attached.
So, in this section, we will only concern ourselves
with calculating the derivatives
of a U(2) matrix.

Mitarai, et al. in Ref. \cite{japan}
and the authors of Xanadu's PennyLane
software Ref.\cite{xanadu}
have come up with a similar
scheme, but their method
differs from ours in some important respects.
To tackle a
general U(2)
transformation,
they first decompose
it
into an Euler
product of 3 rotations along
the standard X,Y or Z axes,
and then they take the derivatives
of each of those 3 rotations.
In this paper,
we
give a
method that can
handle an arbitrary
U(2)
transformation,
without
having to
do an Euler
decomposition first.


Let us first consider  a rotation about
a standard axis, $X, Y$ or $Z$,
instead of a general U(2) matrix.
If we let
 $\sigma_k$ for $k=1,2,3$ denote the Pauli matrices,
 then a rotation about the $Z$ axis
 is

\beq
U(\theta_3) = e^{i\sigma_3\theta_3} = C + i\sigma_3 S
\;,
\eeq
where
$\theta_3$
is some real number and
we abbreviate $S = \sin\theta_3, C = \cos \theta_3$.
Then

\beq
\frac{dU}{dt} = \dot{\theta}_3(-S + i\sigma_3 C)
\;.
\eeq
Hence
\beq
\frac{dU}{d\theta_3}=
-S + i\sigma_3 C=e^{i(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta_3)\sigma_3}
=U(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta_3)
\;.
\eeq
Thus, for a rotation along a standard axis,
one can evaluate the derivative of a gate
simply
by replacing that gate by that gate
with its angle advanced by $\frac{\pi}{2}$.
No need to take finite differences.

Now let us consider the most general U(2).
We will parameterize it as

\beq
U= e^{i(\theta_0 + \theta_1\sigma_X
+ \theta_2\sigma_Y
+ \theta_3\sigma_Z)}
\;,
\label{u2_pametrization}
\eeq
where $\theta_k$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$ are real numbers.
Derivatives with respect to $\theta_0$
are trivial so we will set $\theta_0=0$ henceforth.
Using the Einstein summation convention,

\beq U = e^{i\sigma_k\theta_k} = C +
i\sigma_k \frac{\theta_k}{\theta} S
\;,
\eeq
where we are abbreviating

\beq
\theta = \sqrt{\theta_k\theta_k},
 S = \sin\theta, C = \cos \theta
 \;.
 \eeq
 Then, it's easy to show that

 \beq
 \frac{dU}{dt}=-S \frac{\theta_k}{\theta}
 \dot{\theta_k}+ i\sigma_k\dot{\theta_r}
 \left[\frac{\theta_k\theta_r}{\theta^2} C+
  \frac{S}{\theta}(-\frac{\theta_k\theta_r}{\theta^2}
  + \delta_{k, r})\right]
  \;.
  \label{gen_der}
  \eeq

In the rest of this section,
we will try to recast the right hand side of
 Eq.(\ref{gen_der}) into a form that
 is more convenient for empirical
 calculation from qc data.
Before embarking on this task,
let us introduce some notation.

Henceforth, we will
represent a real-valued unit vector by
a letter with a caret above it:
$\hat{a} = \frac{\vec{a}}{|\vec{a}|}$.
Also, for any real-valued 3-dim vector $\vec{a}$, let

\beq
\sigma_{\vec{a}}=\vec{a}\cdot\vec{\sigma}
\;.
\label{paulions}
\eeq
Eq.(\ref{paulions}) is a natural generalization
of the Pauli matrix notation. If $\hat{e}_A$
is the unit vector in direction $A$ for $A=X,Y,Z$,
then $\hat{e}_A\cdot\vec{\sigma} = \sigma_A$ for
$A=X,Y,Z$. Expressed in
the notation of Eq.(\ref{paulions}),
two familiar Pauli matrix identities
are

\beq
\sigma_{\vec{a}}\sigma_{\vec{b}}=\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}
+ i\sigma_{\vec{a}\times\vec{b}}
\;,
\eeq
where $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$
are any two 3-dim vectors,
and

\beq
e^{i\theta\sigma_{\hat{n}}} = \cos\theta +
i\sigma_{\hat{n}}\sin\theta
\;,
\label{cis}
\eeq
where $\theta$ is a real number and $\hat{n}$
is a 3-dim unit vector. Eq.(\ref{cis})
can be proven by Taylor expanding,
and using $\sigma_{\hat{n}}^2=1$.

We will also use the following notation for the projectors
$P_0$ and $P_1$
along the direction of $\ket{0}$
and $\ket{1}$, respectively,
in a 1-qubit space.

\beq
\begin{array}{l}n=P_1=|1\rangle\langle 1|,\\
\bar{n}=1-n=P_0=|0\rangle\langle 0|
\end{array}
\;.
\eeq
$n$ is often called the number operator.
Whenever we say $\Omega(\alpha)$
for a 1-qubit operator $\Omega$,
we mean $\Omega$ applied to qubit $\alpha$.


Eq.(\ref{gen_der}) for the general form of
$\dot{U}$ when parameterized
as Eq.({\ref{u2_pametrization}) (with $\theta_0=0$)
is fairly opaque.
To clarify
Eq.(\ref{gen_der}),
we start by specializing it to $t=\theta_1$.
The cases $t=\theta_2, \theta_3$
can be obtained from the case
$t=\theta_1$ simply by replacing
1 subscripts in our final result by 2 or 3.
So, setting $t=\theta_1$ in Eq.(\ref{gen_der}),
we immediately get:

\beq
\frac{\partial U}{\partial \theta_1} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
-\frac{\theta_1 S}{\theta^2}
\left[i\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}\right]
\\
+
\frac{\theta_1}{\theta}
\left[-S + i\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}C\right]
\\
+
\frac{S}{\theta}
\left[i\sigma_1\right]
\end{array}
\right.
\;.
\eeq
If we define

\beq
p_1=\frac{\theta_1}{\theta},\;\;p_S = \frac{S}{\theta}
\;,
\eeq
then

\beq
\boxed{
\frac{\partial U}{\partial \theta_1} =
\left\{
\begin{array}{l}
-p_1p_S
\left[e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}}\right]
\\
+
p_1
\left[e^{i(\frac{\pi}{2}+\theta)\sigma_{\hat{\theta}}}\right]
\\
+
p_S
\left[e^{i\frac{\pi}{2}\sigma_1}\right]
\end{array}
\right.
\;.}
\label{eq_boxed}
\eeq

Henceforth,
we will refer to
these 3 pieces as ``dparts", which stands for ``derivative
parts". Note that we can replace 1 by 2 or 3
in Eq.(\ref{eq_boxed}) to get
partials of $U$ with respect to $\theta_2$
and $\theta_3$.

\section{Derivative of Quantum Cost Function}\label{sec-q-cost}
In this section, we show how to
express the
gradient of a quantum cost function as a sum of
mean values that can be
readily evaluated empirically on a real qc.

Suppose $a, A$ are integers such that $a\leq A$,
and $\Omega_j$ are operators acting on $N_b$ qubits.
Define
\beq
\Omega_{[a,A]} = \Omega_a \Omega_{a+1}\ldots \Omega_{A}
\;
\eeq
and

\beq
\Omega_{[A,a]} = \Omega_A\ldots \Omega_{a+1} \Omega_{a}
\;.
\eeq
Note that

\beq
(\Omega_{[a, A]})^\dagger = \Omega^\dagger_{[A,a]}
\;.
\eeq

The cost function that we minimize
in Hybrid Quantum Classical computing
 can be expressed analytically as

\beq C = \bra{\psi_0}(\Omega_{[T-1,0]})^\dagger \hh
\Omega_{[T-1,0]}\ket{\psi_0}
\;,
\label{eq_q_cost_fun}
\eeq
where the $\Omega_j$ are unitary operators
and $\hh$ is a Hermitian operator
acting on $N_b$ qubits. Now let us
focus on
taking the derivative of $\Omega_\tau$, the gate for a particular time
$\tau \in \{0,1, \ldots T-1\}$. Define

\beq
\ket{\psi_\tau} = \Omega_{[\tau-1, 0]}\ket{\psi_0}
\;
\eeq
and

\beq
\hh_\tau = (\Omega_{[T-1,\tau]})^\dagger \hh \Omega_{[T-1,\tau]}
\;.
\eeq
Henceforth,
we will
use the angled brackets to
 denote an average with respect to
state $\ket{\psi_\tau}$:
\beq
\bra{\psi_\tau}\cdot\ket{\psi_\tau}
=
\langle \cdot\rangle
\;.
\eeq
Using the above notation, the
cost function and its derivative
with respect to a parameter $\theta_{\tau 1}$
that lives inside the operator $\Omega_{\tau 1}$,
can be expressed as

\beq
C = \langle \hh_\tau\rangle
\;,
\eeq
and


\beq
\frac{\partial C}{\partial\theta_{\tau 1}}
=
\langle \hh_\tau
\Omega_\tau^\dagger
\frac{\partial \Omega_\tau}{\partial\theta_{\tau 1}}
\rangle
+ h.c.
\;
\label{derv_cost1}
\eeq
h.c. denotes the hermitian conjugate
of the preceding twin expression.

Let $U_{\tau}(0)$
be an element of $SU(2)$ acting on qubit 0.
$U_{\tau}(0)$ can be parameterized as


\beq
U_{\tau}(0)=
e^{i[\theta_{\tau 1}\sigma_X(0)
+
\theta_{\tau 2}\sigma_Y(0)
+
\theta_{\tau 3}\sigma_Z(0)]}
\;,
\eeq
where the $\theta_{\tau d}$ for $d=1,2,3$
are real numbers,
and $\sigma_X(0), \sigma_Y(0), \sigma_Z(0)$
are
the Pauli matrices acting on qubit 0.
For definiteness and as a good illustration,
we will henceforth assume that the
unitary operator $\Omega_\tau$
has the special form
of an SU(2) gate with two controls:

\beq
\Omega_{\tau}=
U_{\tau}(0)^{n(1)n(2)}
\;,
\label{special_omega_tau}
\eeq
where, as usual, $n=\ket{0}\bra{0}$
is the number operator, and $n(1), n(2)$
are number operators acting on qubits 1 and 2,
respectively.
As was shown in Section \ref{sect-deriv},
one can express the partial derivative of
$U_{\tau}(0)$ with respect
 to its parameter $\theta_{\tau 1}$,
as a linear combination


\beq
\frac{\partial U_{\tau}(0)}{\partial\theta_{\tau 1}}
=
\sum_k \lambda_{\tau 1,k} V_{\tau 1,k}(0)
\;,
\label{lin_comb}
\eeq
where the
coefficients $\lambda_{\tau 1,k}$
are real numbers and the
$V_{\tau 1,k}(0)$ are elements of $SU(2)$.
Here
$k=1,2,3$.
From Eqs.(\ref{special_omega_tau})
and (\ref{lin_comb}), it follows that

\beq
\Omega^\dagger_\tau
\frac{\partial \Omega_\tau}{\partial\theta_{\tau 1}}
=
\sum_k \lambda_{\tau 1,k}\left[
n(1)n(2)U^\dagger_{\tau}(0)V_{\tau 1,k}(0)
\right]
\;,
\eeq
which, when substituted into Eq.(\ref{derv_cost1}),
yields:

\beq
\frac{\partial C}{\partial\theta_{\tau 1}}
=
\sum_k \lambda_{\tau 1,k}
\left\langle
\hh_\tau n(1)n(2)U^\dagger_{\tau}(0)V_{\tau 1,k}(0)
+h.c.\right\rangle
\;.
\eeq

Note that
$U^\dagger_{\tau}(0)V_{\tau 1,k}(0)$ is
a product of SU(2) matrices, so
it is itself an SU(2)
matrix acting on qubit 0.
Hence, it can be expressed as

\beq
U^\dagger_{\tau}(0)V_{\tau 1,k}(0)
= \exp[i\alpha_{\tau 1,k} \sigma_{\hat{\alpha}_{\tau 1,k}}(0)]=
W_{\tau 1,k}(0)
\;,
\eeq
where $\alpha_{\tau 1,k}$ is a real number
and $\hat{\alpha}_{\tau 1,k}$ is a real
valued unit vector.

Recall that if $\sigma_Z(\beta)$ is the $Z$ Pauli matrix,
and $n(\beta)=\ket{0}\bra{0}_\beta$ is the number operator,
acting on qubit $\beta$,
then

\beq
1-2n(\beta) = (-1)^{n(\beta)} = \sigma_Z(\beta)
\;.
\eeq
This result relies on the fact
that the projection operator $n$
satisfies $n^2=n$  and, therefore, it
can only have two eigenvalues, 0 and 1.
Let

\beq
\eta(1, 2) = n(1)n(2)
\;.
\eeq
Eta's square also equals itself so
$\eta\in \{0, 1\}$. Therefore

\beq
1-2\eta = (-1)^{\eta} = (-1)^{n(1)n(2)} = \sigma_Z(1)^{n(2)}=
\sigma_Z(2)^{n(1)}
\;.
\eeq

Let ``dpart" (derivative part) stand for
\beq
{\rm dpart} =\langle \hh_\tau  \eta(1,2)W(0)\rangle + h.c.
\;.
\eeq
Since

\beq
\eta= \frac{1}{2}(1- (-1)^\eta)
\;,
\eeq
it follows that
\beq
{\rm dpart}
=
\left\{\begin{array}{r}
\frac{1}{2}\langle \hh_\tau  W\rangle + h.c.
\\
-\frac{1}{2}\langle \hh_\tau  (-1)^\eta W\rangle + h.c.
\end{array}\right.
\;.
\label{top_bot_rhs}
\eeq
Next we add to the quantum circuit
an extra ancilla qubit called $\xi$.
We will refer to the top (resp., bottom)
term on the right hand side of Eq.(\ref{top_bot_rhs})
as depart$_+$ (resp., dpart$_-$). The sign
of the dpart
will be referred to as its ``polarity". We can get
dpart$_\pm$ by
starting the ancilla qubit $\xi$
at $\ket{0}$,
applying a Hadamard
matrix to it,
and measuring the mean value
of $\sigma_X$ for $\xi$.
In other words, one can verify that

\beq
{\rm dpart}_+=
\left[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\bra{\psi_\tau}
&\mid&\hh_\tau &\mid&\ket{\psi_\tau}\\
&(W^\dag)^{n(\xi)}&&W^{n(\xi)}&\\
\bra{0}_\xi
Had(\xi)&\mid&\sigma_X(\xi)&\mid&Had(\xi)\ket{0}_\xi
\end{array}
\right]
\;,
\eeq
and

\beq
{\rm dpart}_-=
-\left[
\begin{array}{ccccc}
\bra{\psi_\tau}
&\mid&\hh_\tau &\mid&\ket{\psi_\tau}\\
&(W^\dag)^{n(\xi)}\sigma_Z(\xi)^\eta&&\sigma_Z(\xi)^\eta W^{n(\xi)}&\\
\bra{0}_\xi
Had(\xi)&\mid&\sigma_X(\xi)&\mid&Had(\xi)\ket{0}_\xi
\end{array}
\right]
\;.
\eeq


\section{Application to a type of
Quantum Neural Net inspired by
Quantum Bayesian Networks
}

So far, we have considered  the derivative
of any single gate of a quantum cost function.
We considered a multi-controlled U(2) gate,
and a derivative with respect to any of its 4 parameters.
But we left the
quantum cost function arbitrary.
In this section, we apply the results
of previous sections to a very special type of
quantum cost function.

More specifically, in
this section we will consider a quantum cost function
$\bra{\psi_T}\hh\ket{\psi_T}$
whose state $\ket{\psi_T}$
is a
quantum circuit
that could be described as a Quantum Neural Net inspired by
Quantum Bayesian Networks.
We will also assume that the Hermitian
operator $\hh$
is given to us already expressed as
 a ``QubitOperator". {\tt QubitOperator}
is a class
in the open-source software
OpenFermion. It
stores $\hh$ as a
a linear combination
 with real coefficients $c_r$
of tensor products
(aka Pauli strings) of a Pauli operator
(or the identity) acting on each qubit:

\beq
\hh = \sum_r c_r \prod_{\beta=0}^{N_b-1}
\sigma_{d_{\beta,r}}(\beta)
\;.
\label{eq_qbit_op}
\eeq
Here $d_{\beta,r} \in \{0,1,2,3\}$
so as to include the identity and the 3 Pauli matrices.



In Qubiter's
implementation of the
ideas of this paper,
we call the quantum
circuit representing $\ket{\psi_T}$
a ``Stairs
Circuit". For example, this is what the
Qubiter's Picture file of a Stairs Circuit
looks like for 3 qubits

\begin{verbatim}
U   |   |
O---U   |
@---U   |
O---O---U
O---@---U
@---O---U
@---@---U
\end{verbatim}

Here, U is a general U(2) matrix with 4 parameters,
all of which can be
made into placeholder variables
or simply kept as floats. If each U is represented by a node and
the controls of each U represent
 its parents, then this quantum circuit
can be represented by a fully connected
Quantum Bayesian Network (QB
net). (See my 10 year old blog called ``Quantum Bayesian Networks" for
more info than you would ever want to know about QB nets).

Qubiter can also be asked to
construct a QB net that is **not** fully
connected, by limiting the number
 of controls for a given U to fewer
than a control on all the qubits to
the left of U.
For example, suppose that in the
3 qubits case, we restrict the
 parents of the U in the last gate to
just one, instead of the 2 parents
 that it has in the fully connected
case. Then we get

\begin{verbatim}
U   |   |
O---U   |
@---U   |
O---+---U
@---+---U
\end{verbatim}
when qubit 0 has qubit 2 but not 1 as a parent,
or

\begin{verbatim}
U   |   |
O---U   |
@---U   |
|   O---U
|   @---U
\end{verbatim}
when qubit 0 has qubit 1 but not 2 as a parent.


Qubiter appends at the end
of  the above
quantum circuits a ``coda" (tail).
Note that

\beq
e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}\sigma_Y}\sigma_Z
e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}\sigma_Y} =\sigma_X
\;,
\eeq

\beq
e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}\sigma_X}\sigma_Z
e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}\sigma_X} =\sigma_Y
\;.
\eeq
A coda is a rotation
$e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}\sigma_Y}$ for every
Pauli $\sigma_X$,
and a rotation
$e^{-i\frac{\pi}{4}\sigma_X}$
for every Pauli $\sigma_Y$,
whenever
$\sigma_X$ or $\sigma_Y$
occur on the right hand side
of Eq.(\ref{eq_qbit_op}).
If such a coda is appended to
the quantum circuit,
then we only have to
measure mean values
of $\sigma_Z$ or 1 on all qubits.
Such mean values
are easy to evaluate because
they are diagonal
matrices of ones and minus ones.

The quantum circuit corresponding to
a  fully connected QB net has a
number of U(2) gates which grows
exponentially with the number of qubits,
and each U(2) gate
has as controls all the qubits
to its left.\footnote{Furthermore, current quantum computers
require exponential complexity
in number of controls to
calculate multi-controlled gates. I
characterize this as a paradox and
a serious shortcoming.} Clearly,
the complexity of
such quantum circuits blows
up exponentially. But suppose we limit
the number of parents of every U(2)
to a fixed number, say, for example, to 2 (except for
the first gate, the ``prior",
 which has no parents, and the second gate,
 which can have only one parent).
 Such parent-limited quantum circuits
 have a complexity
 which increases
 polynomially
 in the number of qubits.
 Which 2 parents are chosen for each U(2)
 can be decided heuristically
in numerous ways. For example,
one can move one parent, chosen at random,
from qubit A to qubit B,
evaluate the cost function
for each case, and choose the parent
with the lower cost.

\section{Threaded Gradients}
As an example,
suppose
that we are taking the derivative
of the third gate,
of the fully connected 3 qubit graph
with respect to $t1 =\theta_1$:

\begin{verbatim}
        U   |   |
        O---U   |
d/dt1   @---U   |
        O---O---U
        O---@---U
        @---O---U
        @---@---U
\end{verbatim}
When we do so,
we get
a quantum circuit with positive
polarity:

\begin{verbatim}
|   U   |   |
|   O---U   |
@---@---U   |
|   O---O---U
|   O---@---U
|   @---O---U
|   @---@---U
\end{verbatim}
and one with negative polarity:

\begin{verbatim}
|   U   |   |
|   O---U   |
@---@---U   |
Z---@   |   |
|   O---O---U
|   O---@---U
|   @---O---U
|   @---@---U
\end{verbatim}
We would also have to
append codas to these circuits.
Note that an ancilla qubit was added,
so the quantum circuit being
differentiated has 3 qubits,
but its derivative parts have 4 qubits.


The idea of ``threaded gradients"
is to partition
all the qubits of a qc into
groups of 4 qubits (4 is just for this example),
and to evolve
each of these 4 qubit islands
independently,
and concurrently.
Each 4 qubit island
is assigned
the task of
evaluating the mean value
of one of the dparts.

Obviously, multi-threading
the task of evaluating
a gradient
of a quantum cost function,
is ideal for a NISQ device,
because it only
requires quantum entanglement
inside small islands of 4
(4 is just for this example) qubits each, but
no correlation among islands.
