Description: # PyStaffo
        *PyStaffo* is a Python wrapper library for the Staffomatic/Easypep API that simplifies many common tasks.
        
        ## Installation
        Either from PyPi:
        
        ```
        $ pip install PyStaffo
        ```
        
        Or from GitHub:
        
        ```
        $ pip install git+https://github.com/perrydunn/PyStaffo
        ```
        
        ## Requirements
        * Python 3 except 3.2 (untested on Python 2)
        * You need a Staffomatic account! A Staffomatic account includes a sub-domain name, and login details as a username and password.
        
        ## Basic Use
        ```
        from pystaffo import StaffoAccount
        
        subdomain = '<subdomain>'
        username = '<username>'
        password = '<password>'
        
        account = StaffoAccount(subdomain=subdomain, username=username, password=password)
        
        # The locations and departments are cached as attributes of the class instance.
        # Return dictionary of {'department_name': department_id, ...}:
        account.locations
        
        # Return the information of a particular location:
        account.get_location('Westway')
        ```
        
        ## Nuts and Bolts
        A ```StaffoAccount()``` instance has various ```GET```, ```PUT``` and ```POST``` API calls expressed as methods: these will be added to. So far there are no ```DELETE``` calls.
        
        Please refer to the ```staffo.py``` for the methods currently available, and feel free to add some more!
        
        ### Timezone Handling
        PyStaffo handles timezones for you, using the timezone detailed in your account. If there are timezone issues you may need to look "under the hood". Please suggest improvements/alternatives.
