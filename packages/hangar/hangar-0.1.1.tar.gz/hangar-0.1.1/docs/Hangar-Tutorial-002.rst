Checkouts, Branching, & Basic Merging

This section describes how to work with branches, and previous
commit histories.

Creating A Branch
=================

The hangar workflow is intended to mimic the best git-flow practices.

::

    Create Branch -> Checkout -> Make Changes -> Commit -> Merge branches


However, unlike GIT, remember that it is not possible to make changes in a
DETACHED HEAD state. Hangar enforces the requirement that all work is performed
at the tip of a branch.
