        The aim of this library is to facilitate verification, validation and 
        uncertainty quantification (VVUQ) for a wide variety of simulations.
        
        Development was funded by the EU Horizon 2020 project [VECMA](http://www.vecma.eu/).
        
        ## Requirements
        
        To use the library you will need Python 3.6+.
        
        ## Installation
        
        We are trying to keep dependencies at a minimum but a few are inevitable, to install them use:
        
        ```
        pip3 install -r requirements.txt
        ```
        
        Then the library can be installed using:
        ```buildoutcfg
        python3 setup.py install
        ```
        
        To complete the tests you need to compile (requires `g++`) the `cannonsim` code:
        ```
        make -C tests/cannonsim/src/ 
        ```
        
        ## Getting Started
