        # Azure IoT Hub Python SDKs v2 - PREVIEW
        
        This repository contains the code for the future v2.0.0 of the Azure IoT SDKs for Python. The goal of v2.0.0 is to be a complete rewrite of the existing SDK that maximizes the use of the Python language and its standard features rather than wrap over the C SDK, like v1.x.x of the SDK did.
        
        **Note that these SDKs are currently in preview, and are subject to change.**
        
        # SDKs
        
        This repository contains the following SDKs:
        
        * [Azure IoT Device SDK](azure-iot-device) - /azure-iot-device
            * Provision a device for use with the Azure IoT Hub
            * Send/receive telemetry between a device and the Azure IoT Hub
            * Handle direct methods invoked by the Azure IoT Hub on a device
        
        * Azure IoT Hub SDK **COMING SOON**
        
        * Azure IoT Hub Provisioning SDK **COMING SOON**
