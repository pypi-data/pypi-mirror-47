Description: GeoParquet for Python is a GeoPandas API designed to facilitate fast
        input/output of GIS data in the open source Parquet file format.
        
        The project is currently a proof of concept.
        
        __Why is this project needed?__
        The GIS community currently lacks a fast, efficient, open-source file format for
        persisting and sharing data with. The purpose of the GeoParquet project is to
        develop such a file format.
        
        __How does it work?__
        The GeoParquet file format is simple adaptation of the existing Parquet file
        format: geometries are stored as well-known binary (WKB), and the coordinate
        reference system is stored as a PROJ string in the file's metadata.
