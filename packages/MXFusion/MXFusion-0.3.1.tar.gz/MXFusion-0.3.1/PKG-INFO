        MXFusion is a modular deep probabilistic programming library.
        
        With MXFusion Modules you can use state-of-the-art inference techniques for specialized probabilistic models without needing to implement those techniques yourself. MXFusion helps you rapidly build and test new methods at scale, by focusing on the modularity of probabilistic models and their integration with modern deep learning techniques.
        
        MXFusion uses [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet) as its computational platform to bring the power of distributed, heterogenous computation to probabilistic modeling.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Dependencies / Prerequisites
        MXFusion's primary dependencies are MXNet >= 1.3 and Networkx >= 2.1.
        See [requirements](requirements/requirements.txt).
        
        ### Supported Architectures / Versions
        
        MXFusion is tested on Python 3.4+ on MacOS and Linux.
        
        ### Installation of MXNet
        
        There are multiple PyPi packages of MXNet. A straight-forward installation with only CPU support can be done by:
        ```
        pip install mxnet
        ```
        
        For an installation with GPU or MKL, detailed instructions can be found on [MXNet site](https://mxnet.apache.org/install/).
        
        ### pip
        If you just want to use MXFusion and not modify the source, you can install through pip:
        ```
        pip install mxfusion
        ```
        
        ### From source
        To install MXFusion from source, after cloning the repository run the following from the top-level directory:
        ```
        pip install .
        ```
