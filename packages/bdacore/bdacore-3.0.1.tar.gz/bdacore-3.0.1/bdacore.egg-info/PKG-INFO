Description: ===============
        What is this?
        ===============
        
        BDA core library of data science and data manipulation functions.
        
        ====================
        How do I install it
        ====================
        
        First, make sure you have miniconda or anaconda installed. If not, `install it! <https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/index.html>`_
        
        
        Then you can install bdacore by running::
        
            make install
        
        This will install the main requirements for running the bdacore lib. If you use advanced methods, you may need to
        install extra packages.
        
        If you want to install all required packages at once, then run::
        
            make develop_env
        
        You may want to override the default package name (bdacore) and Python version (3.6). This can be done by overriding the *ENV_NAME* and *ENV_PY_VERSION* as follows::
        
            make develop_env ENV_NAME=bdacore_py2 ENV_PY_VERSION=2.7
