# Unified Entity System (UES) with unified DXF attribute system for DXF R12 and DXF R2000+
# ========================================================================================
#
# 1. Store entities as DXFEntity () or inherited instances in the drawing database
# 2. remove separation of legacy and modern tag structures
#    - uses owner tag of DXF R2000+ also for DXF R12
#    - same layout structures (BLOCK_RECORDS, LAYOUT, OBJECTS section)
#    - just don't export DXF R2000+ structures to DXF R12 files
# 3. still store unknown entities (Map3d...) as bunch of tag, but inside of an special DXFEntity (DXFTagStorage)
# 4. preserve actual DXFEntity interface, DXFEntity.dxf seem still a good idea - other methods deprecate slowly
# 5. use individual DXF export functions for each entity, but provide a useful boiler plate
