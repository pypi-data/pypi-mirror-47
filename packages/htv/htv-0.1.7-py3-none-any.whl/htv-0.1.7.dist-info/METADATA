# Heat Template Validator
![N|Solid](https://inizanhugo.files.wordpress.com/2018/11/heat.png?w=200)

Heat Template Validator (HTV) is a tool created to validate *Heat templates* (yaml files) and check the parameters' existence in the Openstack server. 

### What does it do?
The main script *htv* will analyze every single file from the dir */htv/TemplateLocalStorage*. 
It moves the valid files into the dir */htv/ValidHeatFiles*.
It moves the warning files into the dir */htv/WarnHeatFiles*. 
It moves the error files into the dir */htv/ErrorHeatFiles* and for each file of the error and warn groups it creates a log and then it moves all log files into the dir */htv/Log*. 
At the very beginning of the installation HTV will also create crontab lines inside the */htv/list_cron.txt* file.
### Installation
HTV requires [python>=3.5] and pip in order to run.
Open the terminal and download the application through *pip*:
```sh
$ pip install htv
```
Then install and configure the package via *htv -i* or *htv --install*:
```sh
$ htv -i
```
There are few simple steps to follow in order to correctly use HTV:
 - Move the Heat files into the *./TemplateLocalStorage* dir
 - Move the open.rc files into the *./rc_files* dir
After this transfer execute *htv -s* or *htv --shadow*:
```sh
$ htv -s
```
Then the application will prompt you the Openstack server password.
Remember to enter this command only once: during the HTV installation, or everytime you need to change the Openstack passwords or *openrc.hs* files.
The *htv -s* command will also generate a list of crontabs in the *list_cron.txt* file that you can use in your system crontab file depending on which *openrc.sh* file is needed.
### Usage
You can choose to run the application using the crontabs created or to run it interactively via *htv*:
```sh
$ htv
```
In the interactive mode the application will ask for which openrc file to use for the Openstack.
After this you are ready to go, the files will be moved accordingly with their warnings or errors and logs will be created and moved to the */htv//Log* dir.
### Remember
Whenever you want to use *htv* you first need to move the yaml files to the */htv/TemplateLocalStorage* dir.
### In case the application directory changes
In case you move the HeatTemplateValidator directory to a different path it is necessary to do as follows:
```sh
$ htv -i
$ htv -s
```
This is a requirement in order to generate the new crontabs and having the whole application working.
### Notes
This application fully functions on Ubuntu and MacOS with *python3* and *pip3* installed.
All advice welcome!
