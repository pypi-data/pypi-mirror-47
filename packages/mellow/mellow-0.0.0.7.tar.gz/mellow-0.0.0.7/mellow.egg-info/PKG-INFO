Description: ## Machine Learning - just do it ! mellow got your back. 
        #### mellow is the python package contains well known machine learning algorithms.
        It provides:
        - most popular machine learning algorithms
        - sophisticated utility functions useful in these algorithms
        - and much more
        
        Often we Developers/Students feel hesitation to implement the machine learning algorithms because</br>
        either they find it hefty or time consuming, what we believe is understanding the machine learning</br>
        is much more important than converting it into code. So we come up with this beautiful library mellow</br>
        to help you out.
