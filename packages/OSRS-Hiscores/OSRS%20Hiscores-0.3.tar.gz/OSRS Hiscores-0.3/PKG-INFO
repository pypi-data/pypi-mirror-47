Description: # OSRS Hiscores API Library
        
        ## Purpose
          The purpose of this library is to interface with Old School Runescape (OSRS)'s Hiscores page and allow developers to access stat levels, ranks, and experience levels in a more intuitive way (via dictionary).  This library accesses this information via a `http.client` request and parses the information accordingly.
        	
        
        ## Installation
        ```
        python -m pip install OSRS-Hiscores
        ```
        
        ## Example Usage
        ```Python
        from OSRS_Hiscores import Hiscores
        
        # User to lookup
        username = 'Zezima'
        
        # Initialize user object
        user = Hiscores(username)
        
        # Get the entire stat dictionary
        user.stats
        
        # Get a specific skill's ranking, level, and experience
        user.stats['runecrafting']
        
        # Get skill's level, ranking, and experience separately
        user.stats['runecrafting']['level']
        user.stats['runecrafting']['rank']
        user.stats['runecrafting']['experience']
        
        # A simpler way to just get a skill's level
        user.skill('attack')
        ```
