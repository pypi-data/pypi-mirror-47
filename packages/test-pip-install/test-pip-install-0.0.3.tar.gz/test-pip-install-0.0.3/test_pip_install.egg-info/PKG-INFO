Description: # Test if `pip install` is working
        
        _This is a basic package that can be used in order to test if `pip install` is
        properly working._
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        This package has no external dependencies. It should be compatible down to
        `Python 2.7`.
        
        Once installed with `pip`, this package should export the `test-pip-install`
        script. The installation can then be tested from a terminal by running:
        
        ```
        >> test-pip-install
        ```
        
        or
        
        ```
        >> python -m test_pip_install
        ```
        
        If the package has been properly installed, you should see something like:
        
        ```
        running Python {version} from {path/to/current/python}
        ```
