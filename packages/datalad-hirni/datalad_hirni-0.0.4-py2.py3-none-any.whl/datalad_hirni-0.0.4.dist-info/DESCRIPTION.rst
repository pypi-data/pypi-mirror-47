This extension enhances DataLad (http://datalad.org) with support for
(semi-)automated, reproducible processing of (medical/neuro)imaging
data. Please see the `extension
documentation <http://datalad-hirni.rtfd.org>`__ for a description on
additional commands and functionality.

For general information on how to use or contribute to DataLad (and this
extension), please see the `DataLad website <http://datalad.org>`__ or
the `main GitHub project page <http://datalad.org>`__.
