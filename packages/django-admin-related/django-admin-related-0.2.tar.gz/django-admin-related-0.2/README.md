Django Admin Related
====================

this project makes it impossible for the user to delete objects that contain other objects related by django admin.

Obs: this project works only in django admin

# Install:
    pip install django-admin-related

# Usage:

1. Add to your INSTALLED_APPS, in settings.py:
    ```
    INSTALLED_APPS = [  
        ...
        'django_admin_related',
        ...
    ]  
    ```

2. Create admin for your model:
    ```
    from django.contrib.admin import register
    from django_admin_related.admin import VerifyRelated

    @register(YouModel)
    class YouModelAdmin(VerifyRelated):
        """
            from best performance use `verify_related_fields`
            because this check all fields is a point to other model
            and `verify_related_fields` is a direct way.
        """
        pass
    ```

3. Test:

        try this: create a simple model, and simple related model, and exclude a first model.

# Advanced:

1. if you need to specify relationships, you can do so :
    ```
    from django.contrib.admin import register
    from django_admin_related.admin import VerifyRelated

    @register(YouModel)
    class YouModelAdmin(VerifyRelated):
        """
            from best performance use `verify_related_fields`
            because this check all fields is a point to other model
            and `verify_related_fields` is a direct way.
        """
        verify_related_fields = ('field', 'field2', ...)
    ```
