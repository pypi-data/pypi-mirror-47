Description: HDCB is an utility to color hexadecimal dumps of
        binary files. It defines its own pseudo-language as an extension to Python to
        make defining new formats as easy as possible.
        
        Currently the Python port is in design phase. Older version, based on bash is
        available as a legacy version.
