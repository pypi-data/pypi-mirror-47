# Time Series Feature Extraction Library
## Intuitive time series feature extraction
This repository hosts the *TSFEL - Time Series Feature Extraction Library* python package. *TSFEL* assists researchers on exploratory feature extraction tasks on time series without requiring significant programming effort.

Users can interact with *TSFEL* using two methods:
##### Online
It does not requires installation as it relies on Google Colabs and a user interface provided by Google Sheets

##### Offline
Advanced users can take full potential of *TSFEL* by installing as a *python* package
```python
pip install https://github.com/fraunhoferportugal/tsfel/archive/v0.0.2.zip
```

## Includes a comprehensive number of features
*TSFEL* is optimized for time series and automatically extracts over 50 different features on the statistical, temporal and spectral domains.

## Functionalities
* **Intuitive, fast deployment and reproducible**: interactive UI for feature selection and customization
* **Computational complexity evaluation**: estimate the computational effort before extracting features
* **Comprehensive documentation**: each feature extraction method has a detailed explanation
* **Unit tested**: we provide unit tests for each feature
* **Easily extended**: adding new features is easy and we encourage you to contribute with your custom features
