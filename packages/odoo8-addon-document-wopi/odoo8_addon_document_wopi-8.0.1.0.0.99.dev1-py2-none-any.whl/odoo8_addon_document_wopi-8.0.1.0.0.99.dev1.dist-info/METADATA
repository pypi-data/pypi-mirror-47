====
WOPI
====

This module was written to implement the `WOPI protocol <http://wopi.readthedocs.io/projects/wopirest>`_ in order to allow online collaborative editing and viewing of office files. This works with `LibreOffice online <https://wiki.documentfoundation.org/Development/LibreOffice_Online>`_/`Collabora online <https://www.collaboraoffice.com/collabora-online>`_ and probably also with Office 365.

Installation
============

To install this module, you need to:

#. have a WOPI client available. For testing, use one of the `Collabora <https://hub.docker.com/r/collabora/code>`_ or `Libreoffice <https://hub.docker.com/r/libreoffice/online/>`_ docker images. The first works out of the box, but is rate limited, the second needs manual interaction, but is unmodified. The `Nextcloud documentation <https://nextcloud.com/collaboraonline/>`_ contains some information on how to get this running
#. have your instance accessible on port 443 via your WOPI client and should have a valid SSL certificate
#. use a dbfilter if necessary to have unauthenticated requests ending up in the database you want

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

#. fill in your WOPI client URL in the configuration wizard

Usage
