Description: REMEDIATE
        ========================
        remediate is a wrapper to fire independent runbooks which were originally 
        python code create for aws lambdas. Without touching them they have been
        repurposed as a target for a Demisto integration. 
        
        There is a layer of indirection in the calling. Plus the feedback from the
        individual runbooks were meant for running in a serverless environment.
        
        Therefore some interesting strategies are used to capture the needed info.
        Mainly string processing.
