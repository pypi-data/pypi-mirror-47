SteelScript Application Framework Installation
==============================================

The SteelScript Application Framework is based on
`Python Django <https://www.djangoproject.com>`_ and builds upon the
Core SteelScript for Python SDK. It provides the foundation for a web
application that can query, process, and display customized metrics and
analysis using `Riverbed's Open APIs <https://support.riverbed.com/apis/>`_
and other data sources.

The Application Framework comes pre-installed and configured in our
`SteelScript VM <https://splash.riverbed.com/docs/DOC-4860>`_.

Once you have the VM up and running in your enviroment, see the complete
:doc:`App Framework documentation </appfwk/overview>`.
