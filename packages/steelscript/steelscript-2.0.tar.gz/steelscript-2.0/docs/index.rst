Riverbed SteelScript for Python
===============================

Welcome, this is the documentation for Riverbed SteelScript for Python
and the SteelScript Application Framework.  The core SteelScript is a
collection of Python modules that build upon REST APIs and other
interfaces to interact with Riverbed appliances and software.
The Application Framework is a Django-based web application infrastructure
that makes it easy to built web applications mashing up configuration
and statistics from throughout your network.

Quick Start
-----------

If you already have pip, just run the following (in a
`virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_)::

   $ pip install steelscript
   $ steel install

Not sure about pip, but you know you have Python?

1. Download :download:`steel_bootstrap.py`

2. Run it (in a `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`_)::

      $ python steel_bootstrap.py install

SteelScript Application Framework
---------------------------------

The SteelScript Application Framework makes it easy to create a fully
custom web application that mashes up data from multiple sources.  It comes
pre-configured with several reports for NetProfiler and NetShark.

Get started with App Framework by downloading and running a Virtual
Machine with it pre-installed and configured.  The latest links
and guides can be found on our
`Splash site <https://splash.riverbed.com/docs/DOC-4860>`_.

For more details, see the :doc:`complete documentation <appfwk/overview>`.

SteelScript SteelHead
---------------------

The SteelScript SteelHead offers a set of interfaces to control and work
with a SteelHead appliance. It comes pre-configured with a couple of example
scripts showing how to interact with a SteelHead appliance using interfaces
provided in this package.

Once you have the base ``steelscript`` package installed, getting started
is just one command away::

   $ steel install --steelhead

For more details, see the :doc:`complete documentation <steelhead/overview>`.
