Description: 
        odeintw
        =======
        
        `odeintw` provides a wrapper of `scipy.integrate.odeint` that allows it to
        handle complex and matrix differential equations.  That is, it can solve
        equations of the form
        
            dZ/dt = F(Z, t, param1, param2, ...)
        
        where `t` is real and `Z` is a real or complex array.
        
        Since `odeintw` is just a wrapper of `scipy.integrate.odeint`, it requires
        `scipy` to be installed.
        
        See README.md at https://github.com/WarrenWeckesser/odeintw for examples.
