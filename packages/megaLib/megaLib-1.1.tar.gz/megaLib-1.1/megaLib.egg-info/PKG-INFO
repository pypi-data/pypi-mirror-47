        [Megaport](https://www.megaport.com/) operates a global, Software Defined Network which enables their customers to 
        manage their connectivity in close to real time. The Megaport API allows customers to interact with their account in 
        the same way as they might using the [Web Portal](https://portal.megaport.com/login).
        
        Use the power of megaLib to order your very own virtual router in the cloud with connectivity to AWS in just a few 
        lines:
