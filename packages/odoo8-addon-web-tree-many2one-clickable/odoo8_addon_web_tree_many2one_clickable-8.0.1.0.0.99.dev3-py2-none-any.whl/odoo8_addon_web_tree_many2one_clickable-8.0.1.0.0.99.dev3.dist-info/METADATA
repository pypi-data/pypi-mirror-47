Clickable many2one fields for tree views
========================================

This addon provides a separate widget to allow many2one or reference fields in
a tree view open the linked resource when clicking on their name.

You can also define a system parameter to have this behaviour for all the
existing many2one fields in tree views.

Installation
============

Install it the regular way.

Configuration
=============

If you want to have all many2one and reference fields clickable by default, you
have to define in *Configuration > Technical > Parameters > System parameters*,
a new parameter with name `web_tree_many2one_clickable.default` and with value
`true`.

Usage
=====

For the widget option, you need to add `widget="many2one_clickable"` attribute
in the XML field definition in the tree view.

For example:

`<field name="partner_id" widget="many2one_clickable" />`

will open the linked partner in a form view.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* You cannot deactivate clickable behaviour for an specific many2one field if
  you configure the system parameter.
* The value of the system parameter is retrieved for each many2one field
  present in the view instead of only once.
