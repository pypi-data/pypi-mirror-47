        Volcasample
        :::::::::::
        
        This is a Python wrapping of the `Korg Volca Sample library`_.
        
        .. caution:: You risk data loss.
        
           This software will delete the factory defaults from your Volca Sample.
        
           Please make sure you know how to restore the `Volca Factory Sample set`_
           before you run the program.
        
        Features
        ========
        
        * Wraps the public interface of the Korg Volca Library so you can call
          it from your Python code.
        * Creates and maintains project spaces so you can store and rate your
          samples.
        * Provides a neat command line interface (CLI) for writing a set of
          samples to your Volca.
        
        Installation
        ============

        in this package. Therefore the `gcc` build tools must be present.
        
        Installation has been tested on Ubuntu 16.04 and MacOSX 10.11.
