======
Hammer
======

Hammering out the variation in deep learning.

This project owes a great debt to the `Vel`_ project from `MillionIntegrals`_. I have basically been
pulling apart his API to better understand it. As of right now, this API is nearly identical to that
project. Things may be adapted and diverge from `Vel` as time goes on in order to suit specific needs.

Documentation
-------------
 
For references, tutorials, and examples check out our `documentation`_.

Usage
-----

The command line interface for BayesCache is as follows:

.. code-block:: console

    python -m bayescache.launch CONFIGFILE COMMAND --device PYTORCH_DEVICE -r RUN_NUMBER -s SEED


Installation
------------

From Sources:

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    git clone git://github.com/yngtodd/bayescache

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console
