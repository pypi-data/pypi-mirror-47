        # waitfornet
        A stupid simple python module to check whether you are online or not
        
        # Synopsis
        
        `waitfornet` is a stupid simple script, all it does is check whether you are online or not, and optionally wait until you go online.
        
        On production servers, you don't need such a script because you are always online. But on home PCs or laptops, we plebeians aren't always online! We sometimes have to fiddle with our WiFi connections, we may have a wireless router but we forget to switch them on sometimes. What if I have a scheduled cron job to run at that moment such as this:
        
            $> task1 && task2 && task3
        	
        The above won't work properly if the tasks are dependent on an internet connection. With `waitfornet`, you can do something like this:
        
            $> waitfornet -w && task1 && task2 && task3
        
        The first command will wait until you go online and once you do, it will exit and then your other crons can run!
        
        # Installation
        
        	pip install waitfornet
        
        # Usage
        	  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
        	  -w, --wait  Wait until online, keep trying
