class TensorflowSHAC(optimizer._SHAC):
    """
    SHAC Engine specifically built for the Graph based workflow of Tensorflow.

    It wraps the abstract SHAC engine with utilities to improve workflow with Tensorflow,
    and performs additional maintenance over the evaluation function, such as creating a
    graph and session for it, and then destroying it and releasing its resources once
    evaluation is over.

    This engine is suitable for Tensorflow based work. Since tensorflow allocates
    memory to the graph, graph maintanence is managed as much as possible. As long
    as the system has enough memory to run multiple copies of the evaluation model,
    there is no additional work required by the user inside the evaluation function.

    Note : When using Eager Execution, it is preferred to use the default `SHAC` engine,
    as memory management is done by Tensorflow automatically in such a scenario.

    # Arguments:
        hyperparameter_list (hp.HyperParameterList | None): A list of parameters
            (or a HyperParameterList) that are passed to define the search space.
            Can be None, so that it is loaded from disk instead.
        total_budget (int): `N`. Defines the total number of models to evaluate.
        num_batches (int): `M`. Defines the number of batches the work is distributed
            to. Must be set such that `total budget` is divisible by `batch size`.
        max_gpu_evaluators (int): number of gpus. Can be 0 or more. Decides the number of
            GPUs used to evaluate models in parallel.
        objective (str): Can be `max` or `min`. Whether to maximise the evaluation
            measure or minimize it.
        max_classifiers (int): Maximum number of classifiers that
            are trained. Default (18) is according to the paper.
        max_cpu_evaluators (int): Positive integer > 0 or -1. Sets the number
            of parallel evaluation functions calls are executed simultaneously.
            Set this to 1 unless you have a lot of memory for 2 or more models
            to be trained simultaneously. If set to -1, uses all CPU cores to
            evaluate N models simultaneously. Will cause OOM if the models are
            large.
        save_dir (str): The base directory where the data of the engine
            will be stored.

        Generated batches of samples, trains `total_classifiers` number of XGBoost models
        and evaluates each batch with the supplied function in parallel.

        Allows manually changing the number of processes that are used to generate samples
        or to evaluate them. While the defaults generally work well, further performance
        gains can be had by trying different values according to the limits of the system.

        ```python
        >>> eval = lambda id, params: np.exp(params['x'])
        >>> shac = TensorflowSHAC(params, total_budget=100, num_batches=10)

        >>> shac.set_num_parallel_generators(20)  # change the number of generator process
        >>> shac.set_num_parallel_evaluators(1)  # change the number of evaluator processes
        >>> shac.generator_backend = 'multiprocessing'  # change the backend for the generator (default is `multiprocessing`)
        >>> shac.concurrent_evaluators()  # change the backend of the evaluator to use `threading`
        ```

        Has an adaptive behaviour based on what epoch it is on, since later epochs require
        far more number of samples to generate a single batch of samples. When the epoch
        number increases beyond 10, it doubles the number of generator processes.

        This adaptivity can be removed by setting the parameter `limit_memory` to True.

            skip_cv_checks (bool): If set, will not perform 5 fold cross validation check
                on the models before adding them to the classifer list. Useful when the
                batch size is small.
            early_stop (bool): Stop running if fail to find a classifier that beats the
                last stage of evaluations.
            relax_checks (bool): If set, will allow samples who do not pass all of the
                checks from all classifiers. Can be useful when large number of models
