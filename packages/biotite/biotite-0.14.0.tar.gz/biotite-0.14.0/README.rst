Biotite project
===============

The *Biotite* package bundles popular tasks in computational biology into an
unifying framework, which is easy to use on the one hand side, but is also
computationally efficient due to intensive usage of *NumPy* and
*Cython*.  This package focuses on working with sequence and structure data and
supports various file formats and analysis and manipulation functions.
