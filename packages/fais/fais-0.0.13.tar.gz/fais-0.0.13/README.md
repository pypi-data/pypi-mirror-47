# Project Title
FAIS - Big Data Gathering package from twitter and USGS

## Getting Started
FAIS is a python package developed using python 3.7, which is not supported by python2. The package is used as a data gathering tools for USGS flood data and Twitter Data. The user can specifically target the flood station in each State for the historical data or real time data in each State. For Twitter, the user can specified the targeted username or keyword with date gape to gather all the tweets that matched the criteria

### Prerequisites

The package dependencies are:            
*  pandas
*  numpy
*  rpy2
*  urllib3
*  requests
*  opencv-python
*  netCDF4
*  matplotlib
*  textblob
*  pyquery
*  tweepy


### Installing

The package can be installed using Pypi installation

    $ pip install fais


## Usage

### Real Time USGS Flood Data

Each states has their own flood monitoring station located throughout the states. The API allows the user to target specific state and get the real time flood information. The user also has choices to either save the data as csv file or return it as a panda dataframe

#### Example 1

The user wants to gather the South Carolina real time data, and save it as a csv file called “sc_realtime.csv”

```python
>>> from fais import usgsgatherer as usgs
>>> usgs.get_realtime_flood_csv(“sc”, “sc_realtime.csv”)

```
The software will download the real time flood reading from every station in South Carolina, deleted the null result, and save it as sc_realtime.csv file at the current directory. The inputs of this function are the targeted State abbreviation and the file name. 

#### Example 2
The user wants to gather the Arizona real time data, return as data frame formatted 

```python
>>> from fais import usgsgatherer as usgs
>>> df = usgs.get_realtime_flood_(“az”)

```
The object df is contain a result of the realtime flood data as a panda data framed formatted.

#### Example 3

The user wants to gather the South Carolina river cam image rocky creek cam station 021603273
The station list can be found at [rivercam](https://www.usgs.gov/centers/sa-water/science/river-webcams-south-atlantic-water-science-center-georgia-north-and-south?qt-science_center_objects=0#qt-science_center_objects)

```python
>>> from fais import usgsgatherer as usgs
>>> img = usgs.get_river_cam_sc_color(“021603273”)

```
The image file will contain an image array of the real time river cam. The image is supported by 
### Historical USGS Flood Data

#### Example 1
The user wants to gather the North Carolina Flood data during the Hurricane Mathew, October 06-07, 2016 with specific station number 0212427947, which is station REEDY CREEK AT SR NR CHARLOTTE, NC  and save it as a csv file called “nc_mathew.csv”

```python
>>> from fais import usgsgatherer
>>> criteria = usgsgatherer.create_usgs_criteria("NC","0212427947", ["00065", "00045","00060"], "2016-10-06", "2016-10-07")
>>> usgs.get_flood_data_csv(criteria, "nc_mathew.csv")

```
The software will download the flood data from REEDY CREEK AT SR NR CHARLOTTE, NC deleted the null result, and save it as nc_mathew.csv file at the current directory. The inputs of this function are the targeted criteria which include the targeted state, station number, parameters, and date and the file name. 
If the user wish to used the result as a data frame object the user required to simply change from get_flood_data_csv() to get_flood_data_dataframe()

#### Example 2 
The user can received the all of the flood station list from each state to used in the historical data gathering as well. To return the station list from North Carolina and save it as a csv file called “nc_station.csv”

```python
>>>from fais import usgsgatherer
>>>criteria = usgsgatherer.get_station_list_csv("NC", "nc_station.csv")

```


### Twitter Data

#### Example 1
The user wants to gather Tweets from the National Weather Service during Hurricane Florence Flood September 20, 2018 – October 20, 2018 and save it as a csv file called “nws_florence.csv”


```python
>>> from fais import twittergatherer 
>>> twitter_username = "nws"
>>> twitter_keyword = None
>>> twitter_since = "2018-09-20"
>>> twitter_until = "2018-10-20"
>>> twitter_criteria = twittergatherer.create_twitter_criteria(twitter_username, twitter_keyword,twitter_since,twitter_until, 10000)
>>> twittergatherer.get_tweets_csv(twitter_criteria, "nws_florence.csv")
```
The software will download all Tweets posted by National Weather Service’s Twitter account since September 20, 2018 – October 20, 2018 with the maximum of 10,000 tweets.
