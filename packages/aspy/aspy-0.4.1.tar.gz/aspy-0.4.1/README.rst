aspy is a python library for producing Activity Streams 2.0 content. It doesn‘t
have a lot of features (no extensions) but aims to be give correct results and
be easy to understand.

At the moment, only supports writing activity streams.

Examples
--------

.. code-block:: python

   import aspy

   martin = aspy.Actor(id='http://www.test.example/martin')
   activity = aspy.Create(
       actor=martin,
       summary='Martin created an image',
       object='http://example.org/foo.jpg',
   )
   # do this to serialize it
   json_string = str(activity)



Caveats
-------

We completely don't support extension types at the moment.

Alternatives
------------

The only python Activity Streams 2 library I know of is `activipy
<https://pypi.org/project/activipy/>`_. It supports extension types, but it‘s
still pre-alpha and seems to have been forgotten.
