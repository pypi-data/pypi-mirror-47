        Starts a program in the guest operating system.
        If program is not executed then it will raise an Exception ''

        :param program: (str) 
         The absolute path to the program to start.
         For Linux guest operating systems, /bin/bash is used to start the program.
         For Solaris guest operating systems, /bin/bash is used to start the program if it exists. 
         Otherwise /bin/sh is used. 
         If /bin/sh is used, then the process ID returned by StartProgramInGuest will be that of 
         the shell used to start the program, rather than the program itself, 
         due to the differences in how /bin/sh and /bin/bash work. 
         This PID will still be usable for watching the process 
         with ListProcessesInGuest to find its exit code and elapsed time.

        :param arguments: (str)
         The arguments to the program. 
         In Linux and Solaris guest operating systems, the program will be executed by a guest shell. 
         This allows stdio redirection, 
         but may also require that characters which must be escaped to the shell also be escaped on the command line provided.
         For Windows guest operating systems, prefixing the command with "cmd /c" can provide stdio redirection.

        :param cwd: (str)
         The absolute path of the working directory for the program to be run. 
         VMware recommends explicitly setting the working directory for the program to be run. 
         If this value is unset or is an empty string, the behavior depends on the guest operating system. 
         For Linux guest operating systems, if this value is unset or is an empty string, 
         the working directory will be the home directory of the user associated with the guest authentication. 
         For other guest operating systems, if this value is unset, the behavior is unspecified.

        :param env_vars: (str)
         An array of environment variables, specified in the guest OS notation 
         (eg PATH=c:bin;c:windowssystem32 or LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib:/lib), 
         to be set for the program being run. 
         Note that these are not additions to the default environment variables; 
         they define the complete set available to the program. 
         If none are specified the values are guest dependent.

        :param start_minimized: (bool)
         This argument applies only for 'Windows' guests.
         Makes any program window start minimized.

        :param wait_for_guest_ready: (bool)
         This argument specifies, whether to check for Guest operation are ready before starting the program.
         If 'True', it halts execution until Guest is ready (or logged in, maybe using auto-logon),
         Else, it directly starts execution.

        :param wait_for_program_to_exit: (bool)
         This argument will wait until the programs gets executed and returns back some value.
         It can also be configured with a 'time-out' period, which will take value from parent VM object. 

        :param credentials: (str)
         Specify the credentials type string.
         Which was added using 'set_credentials' function.
         If string is left empty, it will find the 'default' credentials type and will use them.
         And if it doesn't find any, then it will raise an Exception.

        :param interactive: (bool) 
         This is set to true if the client wants an interactive session in the guest.
