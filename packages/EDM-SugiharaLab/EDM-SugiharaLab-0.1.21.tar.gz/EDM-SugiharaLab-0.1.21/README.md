## Empirical Dynamic Modeling (EDM)
---
This package provides a Python/Pandas DataFrame interface to the [cppEDM](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/cppEDM) library for [EDM analysis](http://deepeco.ucsd.edu/nonlinear-dynamics-research/edm/).  [Documentation](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/pyEDM/blob/master/doc/pyEDM.pdf) is available at [pyEDM](https://github.com/SugiharaLab/pyEDM).

Functionality includes:
* Simplex projection (Sugihara and May 1990)
* Sequential Locally Weighted Global Linear Maps (S-map) (Sugihara 1994)
* Multivariate embeddings (Dixon et. al. 1999)
* Convergent cross mapping (Sugihara et. al. 2012)
* Multiview embedding (Ye and Sugihara 2016)
