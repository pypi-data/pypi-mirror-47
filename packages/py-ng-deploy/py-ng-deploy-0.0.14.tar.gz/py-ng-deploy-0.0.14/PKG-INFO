        Shows version, simple usage and notify if the actual folder doesn't has an rc file.
        ```
        $ pyngDeploy
        ```
        
        > **NOTE** `pyngDeploy` needs to be runned inside the angular project
        
        ### Initialize project
        ```
        $ pyngDeploy init
        ```
        
        >_After `init` is required to edit the .pyngdeployrc file with the following structure:_
        
        ```ini
        [dev]
        Host = localhost
        Username = user
        Password = pass
        RemoteDir = /remote/dir/path
        
        [prod]
        Host = localhost
        Username = user
        Password = pass
        RemoteDir = /remote/dir/path
        ```
        
        > **Remember to exclude the `.pyngdeployrc` file from git**
        
        ### Build and upload (development)
        ```
        $ pyngDeploy dev
        ```
        
        ### Build and upload (production)
        ```
        $ pyngDeploy prod
        ```
        
        ### Build with hash in `<title>` and upload (development)
        ```
        $ pyngDeploy dev --hash
        ```
        
        ### Restore last backup
        ```
        $ pyngDeploy dev --restore
        ```
        
        ## TODO
        - [X] Avoid leaving `None` the `cnopts.hostKeys`
        - [X] Change rcfile to configuration file (.ini)
        - [X] Add colors to `pyngDeploy` messages
        - [X] Add check for .pyngdeployrc when `pyngDeploy` is lauched and send warning
        - [X] Improve upload integration from Windows to Linux
        - [X] Add `Port` key in .pyngdeployrc and read it
        - [ ] Add flag `--skip-build`
