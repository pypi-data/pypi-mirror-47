Summary: this library provides support to construct graphs and their coloring graphs. a coloring graph is a metagraph representing all the valid colorings of a graph. each vertex of a coloring graph represents a coloring of the base graph.

Description: ## coloring-graphs
        [![pipeline status](https://aalok-sathe.gitlab.io/coloring-graphs/build.svg?v=1904688750942904886)](https://gitlab.com/aalok-sathe/coloring-graphs/)
        
        a coloring graphs library written in C++ for speedy computation and wrapped in
        Python for ease of development and extension!
        
        ### what
        this library provides support to construct graphs and their coloring graphs.
        a coloring graph is a metagraph representing all the valid colorings of a graph.
        each vertex of a coloring graph represents a coloring of the base graph.
        
        in this project, we represent a coloring as an integer, which, when converted to
        base k (for a k-coloring), represents the vertex-wise colors [0,k).
        
        the library is under development being written using Python and C/C++.
        for documentation, feel free to take a look inside `libcolgraph/` and read the docstrings.
        for examples, see the files in `test/`.
        for questions, reach out.
        
        ### how
        1. installation:
        
            - manual installation
        
                clone the repository
                - ssh:
                `git clone git@github.com:aalok-sathe/coloring-graphs`
                - https:
                `git clone https://github.com/aalok-sathe/coloring-graphs`
        
                go into the repository
        
                `cd coloring-graphs`
        
                install
        
                `make install`
                
            
            - [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/libcolgraph/) 
        
                `python3 -m pip install libcolgraph [--user]`
        
                issues:
                - currently a binary wheel is available only for `manylinux`
                  enabled distributions
                  e.g. centOS
                - if your distribution is not one of these, then pip will want to
                  compile locally using `setup.py`. in that case,
                  make sure you have [swig](http://www.swig.org/download.html)
                  installed, as it will be needed for compilation.
        
        
        2. quickstart:
        
            - usage:
        
            ```python
            import libcolgraph
            g = libcolgraph.Graph()
            g.load_txt('./test/input/g1.in')
            ```
        
            - run a test suite!
            `make test`
        
            - try the sandbox file (`test/sandbox.py`) to see how plotting works (currently pure python-only)
                - `python3 test/sandbox.py 3`
                - `python3 test/sandbox.py 3 test/input/g1.in`
