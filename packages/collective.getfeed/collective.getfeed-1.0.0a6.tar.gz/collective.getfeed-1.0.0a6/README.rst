Integrate Plone with other websites through feeds.

Development
-----------

Requirements:

- Python 2.7
- Virtualenv

Setup::

  make

Run Static Code Analysis::

  make code-Analysis

Run Unit / Integration Tests::

  make test

Run Robot Framework based acceptance tests::

  make test-acceptance

Installation
-------------

To enable this product in a buildout-based installation:

#. Edit your buildout.cfg and add ``collective.getfeed`` to the list of eggs to install::

    [buildout]
    ...
    eggs =
        collective.getfeed

After updating the configuration you need to run ''bin/buildout'', which will take care of updating your system.

Go to the 'Site Setup' page in a Plone site and click on the 'Add-ons' link.

Check the box next to ``collective.getfeed`` and click the 'Activate' button.

Configuration
-------------

Add a new instance to be called with clock-server to update all feeds automatically:

.. code-block:: ini

    [buildout]
    parts +=
        instance-feeds

    [instance-feeds]
    <=instance
    port-base = 8
    zodb-cache-size = 5000
    zope-conf-additional =
        <clock-server>
           method /Plone/@@get-all-feeds
           period 3600
           user feed_user
           password feed_password
           host localhost:8088
        </clock-server>
