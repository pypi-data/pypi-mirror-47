### How to create filters

Every filter inherits from base class `QuerySetFilter` and include two args: `key` and `lookup`. Filters apply via standard method queryset method `filter`. So, `lookup` will be used for filtering. `key` is an id of a filter and it is used when you provide to gallery engine dict with params for filtering. A filter gets param from dict via `key`.

```
from queryset_gallery.filters import QuerySetFilter

UserEmail = QuerySetFilter(key='email', lookup='email__icontains')
UserIsStaff = QuerySetFilter(key='is_staff', lookup='is_staff')
```

### How to create a gallery

A base class for a gallery in `QuerySetGallery`. When you need to create a gallery you provide django `model` and set `QuerySetFilter` objects in `filters` conts:

```
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from queryset_gallery.gallery import QuerySetGallery

class UserGallery(QuerySetGallery):
    model = User
    filters = [UserEmail, UserIsStaff]
```

The gallery has a method `get_page`. It gets several params like:

```
def get_page(self, page_number, per_page, filter_params: dict=None, queryset=None):
```

The first and second args are params for paginator. The third arg is a dict with params for filters. It includes filter keys and params. Also, you can provide source `queryset` or overdrive method `_get_queryset`, by default all model objects will be used as a source. Then you get the page the gallery return queryset and dict of pagination data.

```
gallery = UserGallery()
params = {
    'email': 'admin',
    'is_staff': True,
}
gallery.get_page(per_page=10, page_number=1, filter_params=params)
```

### How to work with pagination

The pagination has two nuances. If you want to get all objects you can set `per_page` as -1. This way pagination returns all objects. If `per_page` and `neceeery_page` are invalid it returns empty queryset and adds to pagination data dict key `error`.

Example of the pagination data:

```
data =  {
    'objects_count': 20,
    'page_number': 2,
    'page_count': 1,
    'per_page': 100,
    'errors': 'Page data is invalid'
}
```
