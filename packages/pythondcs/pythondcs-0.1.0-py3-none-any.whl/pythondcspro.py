    The DCSSession class can be used to login and interface with a
    Coherent Research DCS v3+ system using it's built in json based

    to the DCS API but with some convenient data conversions.
    
    This extention module builds upon the officially supported methods.
    Nothing defined here is officially documented or supported.
    Therefore it should be used at your own risk.
    
    Use the pythondcs standard module for the officially supported features
    which are also the most commonly required.
    
    The official API methods supported are detailed here, but all of
    the semantics of the API, including the login cookies are
    handled by the class and its methods:
