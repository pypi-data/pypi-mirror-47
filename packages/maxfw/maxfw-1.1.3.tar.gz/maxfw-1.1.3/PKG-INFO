Description: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/MAX-Framework.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/IBM/MAX-Framework) [![PyPy release](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/maxfw.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/maxfw/) 
        
        # Model Asset Exchange Framework
         Python package that contains common code shared across all MAX models.
        
        ## Dependencies
        * [flask-restplus](https://pypi.org/project/flask-restplus/0.11.0/)
        * [flask-cors](https://pypi.org/project/Flask-Cors/)
        
        ## Installation
        
        The package can be installed with pip. However, this is not necessary as each MAX
        model will get the `maxfw` package via the `MAX-Base` image.
        
        If you want to run a MAX model outside of a Docker container then you can install
        it with the following command:
        
            $ pip install -U maxfw
        
        ## Usage
        
        For an example of this package being used in a MAX model, we recommend looking at the
        [MAX-Skeleton Repository on GitHub](https://github.com/IBM/MAX-Skeleton).
