        # Getting started
        
        The easiest way to get ERDOS running is to use our Docker image:
        
        ```console
        docker pull erdosproject/erdos
        ```
        
        # Local installation
        
        ## System requirements
        
        ERDOS is currently known to work on Ubuntu LTS 16.04.
        
        ## Installation instructions
        After cloning the repository, run
        
        ```console
        ./install_dependencies.sh
        ```
        
        This script installs ROS and Python dependencies.
        
        ## Running an example
        
        ```console
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<PATH_TO_ERDOS_DIR>
        cd examples
        python pylot/pylot.py --framework=ray
        ```
        
        ```console
        export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:<PATH_TO_ERDOS_DIR>
        # Setup the ROS paths
        source /opt/ros/kinetic/setup.bash
        # Run the pipeline using ROS
        python pylot/pylot.py --framework=ros
        ```
