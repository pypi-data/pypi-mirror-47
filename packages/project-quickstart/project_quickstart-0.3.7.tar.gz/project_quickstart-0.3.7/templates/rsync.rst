# If you're making copies from a local machine to a remote server you can use
rsync, run e.g.:
#rsync --dry-run -vvazPuiL --exclude-from='rsync_cmd.txt' project_name host_server:remote_url
#rsync -vvazPuiL --exclude-from='rsync_cmd.txt' /full/path/to/project_name host_server:remote_url

# Specify full path names carefully: remote_url should end in "/", e.g. /ifs/projects/proj_YYY/

# Explanation of some options for rsync:

# -u option to avoid deleting newer files at target, ie do not delete the destination file and do not copy the old file.
# --delete delete at target if absent at source (not used here though)
# -z to compress during transmission (faster)
# -P show progress
# -a archive mode; same as -rlptgoD (no -H); which ensures that symbolic links, devices, attributes, permissions,  ownerships, etc. are preserved in the transfer. The -r option copies recursively.
# -i view differences between source and destination files
# -L transform symlink into referent file/dir (which here overwrites the -l included in the archive option).
