README for data folder
######################

Use symbolic links and compressed files as much as possible, this will save
many headaches and storage issues later on.

If data is public, create a README, mark the date, source, etc. and download
but be prepared to delete at a later date when archiving the project.
                                                                                                                                                              
Please generate test/example data which can be used for regression tests (!).
It's important to do alongside coding and analysis.
Test data can be publicly available (e.g. 1000G, GTex) full or partial sets or
simulated datasets for instance.
These serve to test whether changes in the analysis code change or break
results. This is around the minimum standard. They do not test accuracy of the
code.
