        "description": "<p>In 2018, Vodafone sponsored a world champion drone racing pilot. They made a huge splash when they set the world speed record for a VTOL, tilt motor aircraft. They used a fixed-wing aircraft with tilt motors to achieve a speed of 149 MPH. This is now the official time to beat with the Guinness Book Of World Records.</p> <p>The design that was used for the world record was not purpose built and had a lot of compromises. These compromises leave a lot of opportunity for improvement so I think breaking the record is very achievable for a group of makers.</p> <p>Join us in creating a Nova Labs team to design, fabricate and fly a drone that will beat the existing world record and become certified by Guinness! Nova Labs gives us access to some amazing equipment such as laser cutters, CNC and CAD which lend themselves perfectly to this type of challenge. The team is free to join and open to makers of all backgrounds and experience levels. We will meeting weekly to design, fabricate and test our drone so that we can become the new world speed record holders!!</p> ",
