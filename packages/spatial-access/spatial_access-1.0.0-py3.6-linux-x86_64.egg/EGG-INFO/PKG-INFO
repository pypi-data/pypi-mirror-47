        # spatial_access: Compute travel times and spatial access metrics at scale
        Compute travel times and spatial access measures at scale (millions of origin-destination pairs in minutes). 
        Travel times for three modes: walking, biking, driving. 
        Spatial access measures: provider-to-people ratio, avg. time to nearest provider, count/attribute sum of nearby providers, weighted access scores and floating catchment areas.

        Components of spatial_access :
        ----
        spatial_access has two submodules:
        - p2p: Generate many to many matrices with travel times for sets of coordinates. Use `walk` ,`bike` or `drive` network types (import `transit` from other sources), or get the distance in meters.
        - Models: Contains a suite of models for calculating spatial accessibility to amenities.
         
        To use this service as a ReST API, see: https://github.com/GeoDaCenter/spatial_access_api 
        
        If you are a Windows user, instructions for installing Ubuntu on a virtual machine are at the bottom of the Readme.
        
        
        Installation 
        ----
        0. A modern compiler like `gcc` or `clang`.
        
        1. Dependencies 
        
            - MacOS:
        
                `brew install spatialindex`
        
            - Ubuntu:
        
                `sudo apt-get install libspatialindex-dev`
            
                `sudo apt-get install python-tk`
         
        2. Package 
        
            `pip3 install spatial_access`
        
        
        Usage
        ---
        See the iPython notebooks in `docs/` for example usage, or https://readthedocs.org/projects/spatial-acccess/ for technical documentation.
        
        ### Overwriting default configuration values
        p2p provides default configuration values for edge weights and node impedence (see spatial_access/configs.py).
        You can overwrite these as follows:
        ```
        from spatial_access.p2p import TransitMatrix
        from spatial_access.Configs import Configs
        custom_config = Configs()
        # set fields of custom_cofig
        tm = TransitMatrix(..., configs=custom_config)
        # continue with computation 
        ```
        
        
        Maintainance
        ---
        
        ### Instructions for building locally (only for developers):
        
        - Additional requirements: `cython` and `jinja2`
        - To regenerate .pyx files, run: `bash cythonize_extension.sh` (TravisCI will do this automatically on deployment)
        - To install locally, run: `sudo python3 setup.py install ` from spatial_access root directory
        - Unit tests require the `pytest` package. From package root directory, run `python3 -m pytest tests/` to run all unit tests.
        
        ### PyPi Maintenance
        The package lives at: `https://pypi.org/project/spatial-access/`
        
        When a branch is pulled into Master and builds/passes all unit tests,
        Travis CI will automatically deploy the build to PyPi. 
        
        
        To update PyPi access credentials, see .travis.yml and follow the instructions at https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment/pypi/
        to generate a new encrypted password.
        
        
        ### Installing Ubuntu 18 LTS with dependencies from scratch (recommended for Windows users)
        
        1. Follow the instructions at this link: https://linus.nci.nih.gov/bdge/installUbuntu.html to set up a virtual machine
        2. `sudo apt-get update`
        3. `sudo add-apt-repository universe`
        4. `sudo apt-get -y install python3-pip`
        5. Continue with Installation Instructions (above)
