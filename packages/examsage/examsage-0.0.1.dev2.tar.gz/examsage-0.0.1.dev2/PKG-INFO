        Acknowledgments
        ---------------
        The name of this package is a tribute to  William Stein's [SageMath](http://www.sagemath.org/) project, which evolved into the [CoCalc](https://cocalc.com/) platform. Without Stein's contributions to the open source community, ExamSage may have never moved beyond a pure $LaTeX$ solution.
        
        ExamSage interfaces with $LaTeX$ via Jelte Fennema's [PyLaTeX](https://jeltef.github.io/PyLaTeX/) library. Many of the classes provided by ExamSage inherit from classes provided by PyLaTeX. Also, much of my documentation design choices are modeled on the PyLaTeX documentation.
        
        Warning
        -------
        This is my first package and is intended as a learning exercise. In other words, expect nothing to work and everything to change.
