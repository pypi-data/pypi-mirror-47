        # buildMC
        
        A pure Python program that makes building a large, complicated project using CMake or Meson just a single, simple command.
        
        ## Install
        
        Prereqs:
        
        * Python &ge; 3.6
        * CMake &ge; 3.12 _or_ Meson+Ninja
        
        ```sh
        pip install buildmc
        ```
        
        or to use latest development code
        ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/scivision/buildmc
        
        cd buildmc
        
        pip install -e .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        buildMC makes switching between compilers trivial.
        Also, building on native Windows and Windows Subsystem for Linux is detected and handled--the CMake or Meson cache is wiped to allow clean rebuild when switching without fuss.
        
        
        ### Examples
        
        Say you want to ensure a project builds with each of Visual Studio, GNU/GCC, Intel and Clang.
        This can be easily done by typing in the top-level of the project directory:
        
        ```sh
        buildmc msvc
        
        buildmc gnu
        
        buildmc intel
        
        buildmc clang
        ```
        
        Each command independently builds and runs the user-configured tests using CMake or Meson.
        When switching between Windows and Linux (using WSL from Windows) buildMC detects the OS switch and wipes the build cache and rebuilds as needed.
