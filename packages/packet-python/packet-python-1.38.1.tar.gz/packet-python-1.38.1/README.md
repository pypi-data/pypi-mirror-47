Examples
--------
### List projects

import packet
manager = packet.Manager(auth_token="yourapiauthtoken")

projects = manager.list_projects()
for project in projects:
    print(project)
```

### List plans

```python
import packet
manager = packet.Manager(auth_token="yourapiauthtoken")

plans = manager.list_plans()
for plan in plans:
    print(plan)
    if 'cpus' in plan.specs:
        print(plan.specs['cpus'][0]['count'])
```

### Creating a Device

```python
import packet
manager = packet.Manager(auth_token="yourapiauthtoken")

device = manager.create_device(project_id='project-id',
                               hostname='node-name-of-your-choice',
                               plan='baremetal_1', facility='ewr1',
                               operating_system='ubuntu_14_04')
print(device)
```

### Checking the status and rebooting a Device

```python
import packet
manager = packet.Manager(auth_token="yourapiauthtoken")

device = manager.get_device('device-id')
print(device.state)
device.reboot()
```

### Listing all devices, limiting to 50 per page

_Packet API defaults to a limit of 10 per page_

```python
import packet
manager = packet.Manager(auth_token="yourapiauthtoken")
params = {
    'per_page': 50
}
devices = manager.list_devices(project_id='project_id', params = params)
print(devices)
```
