# OpenQEMIST
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/1QB-Information-Technologies/openqemist.svg?token=zt4rNJ8MTUGcpVsToGyy&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/1QB-Information-Technologies/openqemist)

Harnessing the combined power of emerging quantum computing technologies and
state-of-the-art classical techniques, the Quantum-Enabled Molecular ab Initio
Simulation Toolkit, or QEMIST, is 1QBit’s innovative solution to a fundamental
and intractable problem in chemistry: ab initio simulation of molecules.

The accurate prediction of the electronic structure of a molecule is key to the
design of new materials, such as drug compounds and catalyst molecules, by
helping to anticipate a material’s properties before its synthesis in the lab.
However, obtaining this information using classical computers is computationally
intensive, and the resources required for an exact solution scale exponentially
with the size of the problem. Attempts to provide approximate approaches to this
problem on classical computers have been to date either limited to small-sized
systems or compromising on the accuracy of the simulation.

## Installation
To install the package with pip:

1. Follow the setup [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/quantum/install-guide/?view=qsharp-preview) for installing the .NET Core SDK and the Microsoft IQ# module.

2. Install OpenQEMIST with `pip install openqemist`.

To install OpenQEMIST from source, simply clone the GitHub repo and add the package
to your ``PYTHONPATH``. The dependencies for running the project are the Microsoft
.NET Core SDK, IQ#, and qsharp packages as well as pyscf, numpy, and scipy. The
most current list of dependencies, as well as dependencies for building the documentation
can be found in the [Dockerfile](./docker_images/Dockerfile).

## Getting started

To get started install the package, then see the [Jupyter notebooks](./examples/) for example usage.

## Architechture of OpenQEMIST
OpenQEMIST is organized into three layers: problem decomposition, electronic
structure solvers, and hardware backends. The problem decomposition layer is
responsible for splitting the input molecule into smaller subproblems and
treating these using one particular eigenvalue solver (conceivably, fragments
could be treated using multiple solvers), then processing these results into an
overall output energy. Some electronic structure solvers use classical methods,
while others use wrappers over quantum algorithms running on quantum computing
emulators and simulators from quantum platofrm providers. The quantum solver
backend layer implements a common interface over libraries, emulators and
simulators of quantum hardware.

As OpenQEMIST includes a portion of functionalities incorporated in QEMIST, DMET
is the only problem decomposition technique open sourced in our initial release.
This release includes the Full CI and coupled-cluster with single and double
excitations (CCSD) electronic structure solvers, as well as a quantum electronic
structure solver based on the Variational Quantum Eigensolver  (VQE) algorithm.

On the hardware backend, this initial release is integrated with Microsoft
Quantum Development Kit for running the VQE algorithm.
