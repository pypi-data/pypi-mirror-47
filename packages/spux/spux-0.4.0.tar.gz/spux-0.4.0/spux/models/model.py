# List of Model class variables (identical for all instances)
# that could be modified in the custom constructor of the this inherited base class
# self.sandboxing - enable (set to 1), the default option, or disable (set to 0) sandboxing (see below for self.sandbox () usage)

# List of Model instance variables (different for each instance) set by 'isolate/plant' methods and available in all other methods:
# self.sandbox () - path to an isolated sandbox directory (if self.sandboxing == 1)
# self.verbosity - a integer indicating verbosity level for 'print ()' intensity management
# self.seed () - a list containing all hierarchical seeds
# self.seed.cumulative () - a (large) integer seed obtained by combining all hierarchical seeds
# self.rng - numpy.random.RandomState instance for use as 'random_state' in the scipy.stats distributions

# List of basic Model instance methods to be added or modified by the user:
# [optional] self.__init__ (...) - constructor to set internal model properties
# [mandatory] self.init (...) - initialization routine to set initial model state
# [mandatory] self.run (...) - routine to execute the model

# List of advanced Model instance methods to be added or modified by the user:
# [optional] self.exit (...) - finalization routine to clean up model output files
# [optional] self.save (...) - routine to save model state (for non-Python models)
# [optional] self.load (...) - routine to load model state (for non-Python models)
# [optional] self.state (...) - routine to construct an empty model state (for non-Python models)

# NOTE ON SANDBOXING:
# if sandboxing is enabled (and the 'template' argument is specified for the sandbox),
# in any of the above Model instance methods (except self.__init__),
# calling 'self.sandbox ()' returns a path to an isolated (clone of the 'template') directory
