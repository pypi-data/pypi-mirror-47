=============================
Account Due List Days Overdue
=============================

This module adds to the 'Payments and due list' view the number of days that
 an open item is overdue, and classifies the amount due in separate terms
 columns  (e.g. 1-30, 31-60, +61).

The terms columns to show in the list and the number of days for within each
term can be configured.


Configuration
=============

* Go to 'Invoicing / Configuration / Overdue Terms', and add the terms,
  providing the day from, date to and a name that will be displayed in the
  Payments and due list as column.

* It is recommended to always add a last term '+ X' where the 'to days' value
  is a very big value like 99999.


Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to go to:

* Invoicing / Journal Entries / Payments and due list
