==========================
Base Optional Quick Create
==========================

This module allows to avoid to *quick create* new records, through many2one
fields, for a specific model.
You can configure which models should allow *quick create*.
When specified, the *quick create* option will always open the standard create
form.

Got the idea from https://twitter.com/nbessi/status/337869826028605441

=====

To use this module, you need to:

 * go into the menu of *ir_model*,
 * select the model for which you want to disable the quick create option,
 * enable the option *Avoid quick create*.
