        Parameters
        ----------
        wavelength : List[Real] or 1darray
            The wavelengths that correspond to the flux. Needs to be monotonically increasing.
        flux : List[Real] or 1darray
            The flux that the abunance will be found for. Needs to be the same length as wavelength.
        flux_err : List[Real] or 1darray
            The error in each flux point. Needs to be the same length as wavelength.
        eff_t : Real
            The effective temperature of the star.
        surf_g : Real
            The log surface gravity of the star.
        met : Real
            The metallicity of the star.
        accuracy : Real, optional
            The decimal place you want the result to be accurate to.
        method : str, optional
            The method of finding the abundance. Accepted methods are: 'bayes' and 'leastsq'.
        min_abund : Real, optional
            The minimum abundance that the algorithm should search to.
        max_abund : Real, optional
            The maximum abundance that the algorithm should search to.
        initial_accuracy : Real, optional
            The initial accuracy that the algorithm starts searching through. If 'bayes' is returning warnings try decreasing the initial accuracy. Note that this does make the algorithm run slower.
        abunds : List[Real], 1darray, optional
            Determine the abundances you want the probability caculated over. Overrides the min_abund and max_abund parameters. This parameter is ignored if prior is not set. Only used if method is 'bayes'.
        prior : List[Real], 1darray, optional
            Set the prior to the abundances specified via abunds. This parameter is ignored if abunds is not set. Only used if method is 'bayes'. If method is 'bayes' but no prior is set, uses uniform prior. Needs to be the same length as abunds.
