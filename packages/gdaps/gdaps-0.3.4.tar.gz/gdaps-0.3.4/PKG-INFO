Description: 
        The GDAPS library allows Django to make real "pluggable" apps.
        
        A standard Django "app" is *reusable* (if done correctly), but is not *pluggable*,
        like being distributed and "plugged" into a Django main application without modifications. GDAPS is filling this gap.
        
        The reason you want to use GDAPS is: **you want to create an application that should be extended via plugins**. GDAPS consists of a few bells and twistles where Django lacks "automagic":
        
        * Apps are automatically found using setuptools' entry points
        * Apps can provide their own URLs (they are included and merged into urlpatterns automatically)
        * Apps can define ``Interfaces``, that other GDAPS apps then can implement
        * Apps can provide Javascript frontends that are found and compiled automatically (WorkInProgress)

        I was majorly influenced by other plugin systems when writing this code, big thanks to them:
        
        * The [PyUtilib](https://github.com/PyUtilib/pyutilib) library
        * [The Pretix ecosystem](https://pretix.eu/)
        * [Yapsy](http://yapsy.sourceforge.net/)
        * [Django-Rest-Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/)
        * [Graphene-Django](http://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/)
